## Understanding the basics of project management

### What is project management?

Let's start by defining exactly what a project is. A project, is a unique endeavor, and usually includes a set of unique deliverables. It's also a temporary pursuit. It has a defined beginning and an end. To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a desired outcome. Reaching that desired outcome takes collaboration and careful planning that keeps the project on track and on budget. That's where project management comes in. Project management is critical to the success of projects both big and small. Let's break it down into the what, the why, and the how. What is project management? Why is project management an important part of an organization? How is it vital to a project's success? As I mentioned, project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected outcomes, both on time and within budget. To demonstrate what I mean I'll take you through a real-life example of project management. Imagine a school district signs a deal with a tele-health company to make sure students don't have to miss school for simple health issues, like fevers or headaches. The deal will be completed by the end of the school year. The students can now interact with the doctor through a tablet, smartphone, or a computer, while they're at school. Implementing this technology into the school's procedures is the project. It's got a clear outcome and start and end date. So, how is that project managed? Well, this project has several tasks, and each one has to be carefully planned out and tracked, or managed, in order for the project to be completed. For example, to start you can organize training sessions for faculty to get them better acquainted with the technology, policies, and procedures. You can budget for tablets, computers, and other vital equipment to facilitate the virtual checkups. You can maintain strong communication with doctors, the tele-health company, and school staff members and so much more. To successfully launch the product in the schools all of those things need to get done. That is project management. Seems pretty important to an organization's success, right? More and more companies are starting to understand how project management can save them lots of money and time. Poor project management can lead to trillions of wasted dollars every year for organizations around the world. More specifically, poor project management can lead to 48 percent of projects missing delivery dates, 43 percent missing budget targets, and 31 percent failing to meet an organization's goals. As a company that serves so many different purposes in communities, it's no surprise that project management's a huge part of Google. But here, many of our project managers are described as "program managers," because they manage multiple projects for specific products, teams, or programs. There are thousands of people here with the job of keeping projects and programs running smoothly. People like me. I'm a responsible innovation program manager. My team is responsible for ensuring that the technology we produce, the research we pursue, and the publications we put out are all done with Google's artificial intelligence principles in mind. I review the processes for each of these types of technologies, and I give ideas for how to continue innovating responsibly to meet our organizational goals. My job adds value to Google through the core aspects of project management we've mentioned, planning and organizing, managing tasks, and budgeting and controlling costs. Hopefully you have a better sense of what a project is, what project management is, and why project management is an important part of every company, and how it's vital to a project's success. Next up, we'll learn more about what a project manager does.
