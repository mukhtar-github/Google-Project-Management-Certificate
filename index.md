## Understanding the basics of project management

### What is project management?

Let's start by defining exactly what a project is. A project, is a unique endeavor, and usually includes a set of unique deliverables. It's also a temporary pursuit. It has a defined beginning and an end. To put it another way, a project is a series of tasks that need to be completed to reach a desired outcome. Reaching that desired outcome takes collaboration and careful planning that keeps the project on track and on budget. That's where project management comes in. Project management is critical to the success of projects both big and small. Let's break it down into the what, the why, and the how. What is project management? Why is project management an important part of an organization? How is it vital to a project's success? As I mentioned, project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected outcomes, both on time and within budget. To demonstrate what I mean I'll take you through a real-life example of project management. Imagine a school district signs a deal with a tele-health company to make sure students don't have to miss school for simple health issues, like fevers or headaches. The deal will be completed by the end of the school year. The students can now interact with the doctor through a tablet, smartphone, or a computer, while they're at school. Implementing this technology into the school's procedures is the project. It's got a clear outcome and start and end date. So, how is that project managed? Well, this project has several tasks, and each one has to be carefully planned out and tracked, or managed, in order for the project to be completed. For example, to start you can organize training sessions for faculty to get them better acquainted with the technology, policies, and procedures. You can budget for tablets, computers, and other vital equipment to facilitate the virtual checkups. You can maintain strong communication with doctors, the tele-health company, and school staff members and so much more. To successfully launch the product in the schools all of those things need to get done. That is project management. Seems pretty important to an organization's success, right? More and more companies are starting to understand how project management can save them lots of money and time. Poor project management can lead to trillions of wasted dollars every year for organizations around the world. More specifically, poor project management can lead to 48 percent of projects missing delivery dates, 43 percent missing budget targets, and 31 percent failing to meet an organization's goals. As a company that serves so many different purposes in communities, it's no surprise that project management's a huge part of Google. But here, many of our project managers are described as "program managers," because they manage multiple projects for specific products, teams, or programs. There are thousands of people here with the job of keeping projects and programs running smoothly. People like me. I'm a responsible innovation program manager. My team is responsible for ensuring that the technology we produce, the research we pursue, and the publications we put out are all done with Google's artificial intelligence principles in mind. I review the processes for each of these types of technologies, and I give ideas for how to continue innovating responsibly to meet our organizational goals. My job adds value to Google through the core aspects of project management we've mentioned, planning and organizing, managing tasks, and budgeting and controlling costs. Hopefully you have a better sense of what a project is, what project management is, and why project management is an important part of every company, and how it's vital to a project's success. Next up, we'll learn more about what a project manager does.

### What does a project manager do?

Now, let's learn more about what project managers do on a day-to-day basis. Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors. Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and on budget. In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that the project outcome is bringing value to the company. A project manager can add value in many different ways. Whether that's creating a new service for customers or modifying an old service so it's more tailored to the customer's needs. No matter what the task is, a successful project will always add value. And it's the project manager's job to make sure that project is both valuable and successful. You may be asking yourself, well, if I'm a project manager, how do I add value to an organization every day? What does the day-to-day life of a project manager look like? Well, a project manager's responsibilities can vary, depending on the project, the industry, and the company they're working in. Are you constructing a new building? Are you project managing a renewable energy product in a startup? Or are you setting up your own event management company? Your tasks will be different in each scenario, but here's a general overview of what a typical day might look like.

A project manager's daily responsibilities always include some version of the following, planning and organizing. An example of that might be gathering requirements from teammates or customers. This means figuring out what exactly your project's trying to accomplish. You might have a kickoff meeting or send a survey. From here you may also work on creating project plans. Creating project plans is a key part of project management. It helps set the tone of the project, keeps everyone on pace and aligned, and helps move tasks along. Which leads me to my second point, managing tasks. Once the project is underway, the project manager helps manage tasks for the team members and communicates key milestones to the larger team or customers. This helps keep team members, and customers updated on how the project is progressing. The third piece is budgeting and controlling costs and other factors. Managing the budget and controlling costs is a common responsibility that project managers have to understand to keep the project on track and within budget. This is a full-time job because the plan you've created and managed may change causing unexpected costs to come up. And that's just to name a few. I could go on for days. But the most important thing to know about the day to day of a project manager is this: You'll use different tools, techniques and methodologies every single day. There's never a dull moment. Personally, my favorite part about being a project manager is that I get to watch the project's growth from start to finish. It's really special to create something from nothing, working from the ground up. It's a really satisfying feeling. As a project manager, you'll use a variety of skills every day, and a lot of these skills you might already have, and we'll discuss this more coming up.

### Transferable project management skills

Let's get right into it and explore the variety of skills you'll use. Have you ever been tasked with planning a loved one's surprise birthday party? There's usually a lot of pressure and responsibility, but when you get it right, it feels amazing. That's still true even if there were a couple of issues. Maybe the guest of honor arrived home earlier than expected and nearly ruined the surprise. But if you made someone feel special on their birthday you probably planned a successful project. As you chose a venue, sent out invitations, and calculated your budget based on your number of guests, you were using several project management skills, like planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs, and more. Or maybe you've never planned a party. Have you ever worked in the retail space, or in the service industry? Then you might have experience that'll translate into the project management field, too. For example, you might have been in charge of managing several employees' schedules. To do that, you had to plan and organize which employees' work styles would complement each other in a productive way. You also had to make sure that all duties and responsibilities would be covered during each shift. Plus, you had to be aware of all employees' availability. Doesn't sound familiar? Well, have you ever had to relocate for a new job and planned a big move? To successfully move all of your belongings, you may have coordinated friends and family to help. You would have had to budget and control costs for moving companies, boxes, and miscellaneous expenses. You probably packed your boxes one room at a time and clearly labeled the boxes so that you knew what each box was when you arrived at the new place. You had to manage all of these tasks simultaneously. You've likely handled several tasks like these in your lifetime. In studying project management, you'll learn to further advance and sharpen these skills so that you'll be equipped to manage even bigger, more daunting tasks. The abilities that helped you complete these past projects are a great selling point for yourself as a future project manager. So be sure to bring up these examples in job interviews to demonstrate your skills. For instance, if you're asked questions like, "Tell me about a time when you had to juggle several tasks at once", or "Tell me about a time when you had to influence a customer or a teammate." It's good to have examples that demonstrate your skills with time management and leadership in both your everyday life and previous workplaces. Are you thinking about all of the skills that you already have and can use in your future project management role? Perfect. Up next, we'll learn more about the types of project management roles that you'll be qualified for after this program. We'll also discuss how to start exploring the various job opportunities out there for you.

### X: Path to becoming a project manager

Hey everyone, my name is X. Yes, just the letter. At Google, I'm a Program Manager for a department called Responsible Innovation. Most of us, in our everyday life, use program management. When you have only a couple hours left in a day and you have to figure out, well, do I clean my house or do I go to the grocery store? How long will each of those task takes? Those are just different elements or variations of program management and project management. My path to program management is pretty non-traditional. I didn't go graduate from a great college. In fact, I dropped out of high school and I dropped out of college. So a GED is the highest credential that I have. After I dropped out of high school, I taught myself how to code. I built a whole bunch of websites, but realized, like, I didn't have the responsible skills to make me a "mature adult." So I ended up joining the military. After spending eight years in the Army, I traveled the world building apps for really big companies and governments around the world. When I came into Google, I realized I could still be technical, but then I'm just using the skills I already have. So how can I grow myself as a person by learning new skills? That's when I heard about the program manager role. The program manager role at Google is super cool because it varies depending on which team you're on. If you're a program manager on Google Cloud, that could look very different than being a program manager in YouTube. That switch up and that change from coding all day long in front of a computer screen was something that was really, really attractive to me. Some of the biggest skills from my past and my history that helped me become a program manager and make that transition from somebody who was managed by program and project managers, to actually becoming one myself, was taking a little bit more accountability in my personal life. There's lots of things I want to learn in life. I started doing things like making schedules to practice, like, different instruments, like the bass guitar. Each of my roles, whenever I worked with a project or program manager, I also made sure to check in with them about why they were doing what they were doing. I'm someone who doesn't really learn from books if you can't tell by me dropping out of school. So I always found somebody who was willing to teach me why they were doing what they were doing, because that's how I learn. I tend to be more kinetic. I learn as I go. Program management to me was a natural calling. Not because I like to run around and tell everybody what to do, but because I have a real personal passion for bringing people together and getting everybody on the same page to move towards the same goal. Whether that's convincing all my friends to go to my favorite vegan spot in downtown LA, like four times a week, or whether that's getting us all together to resolve conflict or to work on an idea and collaborate on projects on the side together. Those skills that you use in your everyday life to keep your task together can apply to program and project management very easily. You just have to be a little bit more intentional around them and there's a lot more paperwork involved.

## Learning about careers in project management

### From certificate to career success

Welcome back. Now that you have a general understanding of what a project manager does, let's focus on the types of jobs that you may be qualified for after completing this program. To start, I've got a question for you. How many open roles do you think are out there for project managers? Hint: The answer is a very big number. Project managers are in high demand. In 2017, a study by the Project Management Institute found that by the year 2027, employers will need 87.7 million people filling project management-aligned roles. According to that same study, the industries with the most growth are manufacturing and construction, information services and publishing, management and professional services, finance and insurance, utilities, and oil and gas. Project management plays a big part in helping all of these industries grow. In some industries, you will find the term "project manager" grouped with a more industry-specific qualifying word. For example: "construction project manager" or "IT project manager," or "engineering project manager." Don't worry. These are all still project manager roles—they're just specific to an industry. And it's important to keep in mind that the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry. New projects are popping up every single day. Across all industries, we noticed that new technology is introduced, which leads to processes changing and a need to manage those processes. So all kinds of companies need people like you who can tackle a variety of projects from start to finish, to help them navigate these changes. By now, you might have noticed that you already have some of those skills, like organizing or planning an event, problem-solving, or even managing a budget, and you use them effectively in your everyday life. Reflect on some of those skills we mentioned earlier and ask yourself, what are some of the parts of project management that you're drawn to? While you may not have the answer just yet, thinking about these things can help you find suitable roles later. As you keep going in this program, try to keep track of the lessons and activities you prefer and the ones you didn't like as much. This will help you narrow your choices as you search through job boards later. The beauty of project management is that you don't need to be an expert on a focused technical topic— you just need to be able to manage projects. You could be a construction or technology project manager, or you could enter the healthcare industry and work in patient management. You could also enter the energy sector and act as an environmental project manager. The possibilities are almost endless. What's equally exciting is that you could even end up with a completely different title altogether. For instance, there are roles that entail a sequence of ongoing projects that are considered programs or operations in the industry. In this case, the role may not be described as a project manager, but instead something a little more evergreen, like "operations manager" or "program manager." Other titles that might make sense for you can include "operations assistant," "project assistant," "project coordinator," and "program assistant." When it comes to job duties, your responsibilities might change depending on the type of company you choose. For example, the workload and specific tasks at a small agency will be different from those at Google. It's also important to keep in mind that as the world continues to change and evolve, so do industries and the job opportunities you'll find there. So be sure to cast a wide net. You'll be able to find more and more jobs you're qualified for. In addition to being qualified for project management-related jobs, there's plenty of other roles or paths that may interest you. Internships can sometimes be a good place to start. An internship is a short-term way to get hands-on experience in an industry. Plus, internships are a great way to help boost your resume and set yourself apart from other candidates. One of the key benefits of internships is that you get real work experience while simultaneously networking with people in that industry. It's a win-win. Now some internships in your field might not technically be project manager roles, but a lot of roles are easily transferable. For example, something like an "events manager intern" role can become a full-time project manager position later on. Internships aren't great for everyone's lifestyle, but if you can make them work, they're a fantastic option. Another path you can take is contract work. Working for companies on a contract means you'll work with them on a project-by-project basis, but you won't be a full-time employee. This kind of work is a great way to get your foot in the door and build your portfolio. Plus, it gives you the flexibility to try your hand at a few different projects at once, depending on the commitment level required for that. Another benefit of contracting is that it lets you explore different kinds of companies and project types. Since it's a temporary position, you can explore what type of company is the best fit for you. Maybe you find you like working with a large or a small team, or you find you enjoy specific types of projects. And if you find a situation that suits you and the organization, your contract position might just lead to a full-time position. As you keep charging forward, try thinking about the type of job you might be interested in going after when we're done here. Every new topic you discover brings you one step closer to your first role in project management, and one step closer to where you want to be. In the next video, we'll learn how to identify and search for job titles best-suited for a project manager.

### Explore project management roles

You are about to start on your path to securing a high-demand position as a project manager. One of the greatest benefits of the project management field is that it encompasses a wide variety of positions across numerous industries. As you complete this certification, you will acquire skills that will qualify you for various job titles. Here, we will discuss some different project management job categories and some common roles within those categories. We’ll also describe the great potential for career progression in project management, from entry-level positions to senior program management roles, and the many opportunities in between!

#### Project management job categories and common roles

#### Introductory-level project management roles

Entry-level project management positions are a great opportunity to get your foot in the door and learn the ins and outs of how a company operates and manages projects. The lessons you learn from these experiences are extremely valuable to your growth in project management. Some entry-level project management positions include:

- **Junior Project Manager:** Performs all aspects of being a project manager alongside a more experienced professional.

- **Project Administrator:** Assists the rest of the project team with administrative tasks.

- **Project/Program Assistant:** Supports team members working on a project and offers administrative support. May perform research or create training documents along with other jobs as assigned by program leaders.

- **Project/Program Coordinator:** Participates in hands-on project work and administrative tasks. Works under a project manager to make sure projects are completed on time and within budget.

- **Project Support Specialist:** Works alongside a project manager and team members to oversee assigned projects. May also be responsible for training and developing employees to perform designated tasks.

#### Traditional project management roles

Once you have gained some experience in introductory-level positions, you can explore traditional project management roles, such as:

- **Project Manager:** Responsible for the initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing of a project. Includes industry-specific titles like IT project manager, construction project manager, or engineering project manager, which utilize skills that are transferable among industries.

- **Project Analyst:** Moves a project along by sharing information, providing support through data analysis, and contributing to strategy and performance.

- **Project Leader/Director:** Drives core decision-making and sets the direction for the project. Usually knowledgeable about the product or deliverable.

- **Project Controller:** Primarily responsible for project planning. You are likely to see this job title in industries like engineering and construction.

- **Technical Project Manager:** Conducts project planning and management for identified goals within a company. Ensures that projects are completed to the requirements within a defined time frame and budget.

- **Project Management Office (PMO) Analyst:** Manages the progress of complex projects to ensure timely execution and completion.

#### Program and portfolio management roles

As you have learned, project managers are responsible for the day-to-day management of projects. They shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as a guide for their team. Project managers must apply the right tools, techniques, and processes to complete the project successfully, on time, and within budget.

After you have carried out projects successfully and feel you are ready for a step up in responsibility, a **program** manager position may be the next step for you. While a project is one single-focused endeavor, a program is a collection of projects. Program managers are responsible for managing many projects. At Google, all project managers are called program managers because they manage multiple projects simultaneously.

Successfully implementing programs as a program manager can eventually make you a great fit for more senior positions, such as a senior program manager or a portfolio manager. A **portfolio** is a collection of projects and programs across an entire organization. Portfolio managers are responsible for portfolios of projects or programs for one client. Over the course of your career, you might progress from project manager to program manager to portfolio manager roles.

While project, program, and portfolio managers hold different types and levels of responsibility, they are all project managers. In Course 4 of this certificate program, you will learn more about differentiating projects, programs, and portfolios.

- **Program managers:** Manage a group of projects that are related or similar to one another and handle the coordination of these projects. They facilitate effective communication between individual project managers and provide support where necessary. They also help create and manage long-term goals for their organization.

- **Portfolio managers:** Responsible for managing a group of related programs within the same organization. They coordinate various programs in order to ensure they are on track and that the organization is meeting its strategic initiatives. Portfolio managers look at all projects and programs within the organization and prioritize work as necessary.

**Operational management roles**

In operational management roles, you will get the opportunity to experience several different departments and how they interact and operate. Operational management roles allow you to work alongside peers and management from various business segments, giving you an appreciation for what each segment does on a daily basis. Key elements of project management include making sure a project is on budget and on schedule. This course, and your experience as a project manager, will give you the tools to be able to apply those skills to running a business. Some operational management positions include:

- **Operations Analyst:** Manages and coordinates research, investigates workflows, creates business procedures, and recommends changes to improve the project and company.

- **Operations Manager:** Oversees strategic decision-making and rolls out plans of action based on financial, schedule, and resource reporting.

- **Chief Operating Officer:** Responsible for overseeing the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business.

#### Agile roles

We will discuss the Agile project management approach in depth later, but here are a couple of the positions you may see that are related to that approach:

- **Scrum Master:** Coordinates and guides the Scrum team. Knowledgeable in Agile framework and Scrum and is able to teach others about the Scrum values and principles. May also be listed as a Technical Program Manager or Technical Project Manager.

- **Product Owner:** Drives the direction of product development and progress.

#### Industry-specific management roles

As you search for project management roles, you may see positions with titles like “engineering project manager” or “construction project manager.” Keep in mind that the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry. For example, you may have experience as a software engineer but are interested in pursuing a career in project management. You will be able to apply what you’ve learned working in a technical field, as well as with the skills you have picked up in this certification course, to a project manager position in multiple industries. Having experience working on a team to achieve a task and understanding how to execute an effort on schedule and on budget are aspects of your professional experience—combined with your project management knowledge—that make it possible for you to move between industries.

#### Key takeaway

Project management is a career path with a great deal of potential!

With each step along your career path, you are building yourself up to be a significant contributor to any company. We have discussed a number of possible job titles for you to search for when you start exploring project management roles. Regardless of the industry in which you currently work, you have gained transferable skills. Transferable skills are abilities that can be used in many different jobs and career paths. Your transferable skills can likely be utilized in project management roles in many other industries.

#### Finding the perfect role

Let's discuss how to search for a job in the project management field. It's no secret that job searching can be a challenge. Even the most detailed, specific job listings can leave you wondering what the company is really seeking in a candidate. Don't worry, we've all been there, and we're here to help you sort through the lingo and the confusion. The more job listings you find, the more buzzwords you'll likely notice, too— words like "data-driven," "team player," "self-starter." Understanding all the buzzwords in job listings will help figure out if a job is right for you. Up to now, we've discussed project management as a role, but many companies actually list it as a skill. Here's some more good news. You'll soon be qualified for a position as a project manager, and a position that lists project management as a skill. Here's the even better news. If you have the skills to manage projects, you'll be qualified for program manager or operational roles that require you to manage an end-to-end system or department, too, which asks for the same skill set. Now, let's check out different types of jobs that use your project management skills. When job hunting, keep your options open. As I just mentioned, you don't have to limit yourself to just project manager titles. There's lots of other titles you're qualified for, too. You'll know what's a good fit for you by reading the job descriptions, so cast a wide net. Depending on the field you choose, you might find roles like Operations Manager, Program Manager, Operations Associate, or Project Assistant. All of these could be a great fit for your skills. For example, let's say you're searching a job board for project management roles when you notice a Community Operations Manager role for a small city open up. The job title isn't project manager, but you'll notice that the job functions match your skill set, and your years of experience also match the job requirements. The job description may include a list of required skills like organizational management, strong planning and communication skills, budget preparation and monitoring. Sound familiar? Maybe you'll even start to notice that the job's responsibilities seem like tasks you've covered in this course, like creating monthly status reports, helping to implement new and necessary technologies, tracking work plans and performance metrics, assisting other members of the operations team on given projects, and ensuring timely responses to requests for information. These duties are nearly a perfect match for your project management skills, and there are plenty more listings like these two. How great is that? The skills that go into project management are used in all kinds of roles and professions. Believe it or not, we've all worked with or learned from a project manager at some point in the past. Can you guess who that is? It's your teachers! Think about it. Everything that goes into being a teacher takes project management skills: Designing a curriculum that's accessible to students with unique needs; managing a budget; communicating with others like parents, department heads, or school admins; developing processes to make things run efficiently in the classroom; and so on. For example, when I went for my first interview at Google, I highlighted my experience as the founder and advisor to a student leadership group. I told them about how I assembled and led a team of 20 students to plan and execute events like fundraisers, community gatherings, and academic assemblies for over 300 students during the academic year. I even kind of surprised myself, looking back at how much relevant project management experience I had. Now, I'm sure you'll think back on your own experiences and feel the same thing. One more thing to call out is networking. Networking is when you meet other people in a professional setting with the goal of learning, sharing knowledge, and creating new business connections. This plays a big role in job hunting, so it is a great tool to start learning and perfecting. The skills you learn here will prepare you for all kinds of project management jobs. Knowing how to search for jobs will make it even easier to match those skills with the best opportunities for you.

### Gilbert: Project management skills in my role

My name is Gilbert, and I'm a talent outreach specialist here at Google. Talent can mean many things; it can mean folks that have never envisioned themselves at Google. And so part of our team's remit is to identify talent that Google or other companies may not necessarily reach out to, or consider for roles in the past and helping them navigate the interview process. That could also mean candidates that are already interested or have expressed interest in opportunities at Google in the past, and engaging them to support them through the interview process today. At Google you have to wear the program and project management hat, regardless of what role you're in. And that's definitely been the case for me. So in my role I've had to practice skills such as: communicating to stakeholders, managing a budget, managing a project timeline in many different projects within my role. An example of this could be organizing events for university students that come to Google's campus. And hear from guest speakers about the projects we work on, the roles and their career journeys. And so as you can imagine this can be a complex project. My first job out of college was completely unrelated to what I'm doing now. I was an assistant manager at a big box retailer. And so a lot of the skills that I actually learned in that role have translated to support me in my role and allowed me to have success. So some of these skills are being able to talk to and have difficult conversations, being able to manage a budget, managing resources, and managing your time. These are especially important in the retail setting. I started applying a lot of these project management frameworks or practices, even into the smallest projects. Maybe it's related to my goals for the next three months, setting up project plan based around that, right? I was the only stakeholder, I was the only one reviewing this documentation. But the practice of being able to do this really helped me so that when I had to do it for a project at Google with multiple stakeholders, with multiple timelines, competing priorities. It was already second nature to me, because I even applied it just in my day to day. So I think one of the biggest support that I had as far as working through imposter syndrome, or lack of confidence as I stepped into a lot of these skills is really just practice. And you can practice it in many different ways, in your personal life, in your professional life, and anything in between. So that was really important for me as I've gone through this journey of up-skilling as a program and project manager. I'd say that by joining this course and stepping into this, you're already taking the first step. And I think that's just as important, right? Not letting fear, or fear of failure get in the way of new opportunities for you. And the second piece is don't be afraid to ask for help. I think that folks are generally willing to help and support you. So the biggest thing that you can do is reach out, and not be afraid to ask questions. Not be afraid to do an informational interview, to ask for resume tips, to ask for advice from people that are maybe already in the role that you're hoping to step into, or in the field that you're looking to work in. Just reach out to them, ask them questions. I think people like to connect with folks that are intuitive, that are curious and are just eager to learn. And so if you can leverage those two pieces, I think that you're going to have success in whatever you do.

### Using buzzwords in your job search

You now know how to start searching for project management jobs! Job searching can be a time of self-reflection, growth, and excitement. Add a career path change into the mix, and it can also seem intimidating. We are about to give you some tips to help you in your job search efforts, including introducing you to some common buzzwords and skills that commonly appear in job descriptions.

#### Using buzzwords and skills in your job search

In an earlier video, we mentioned **buzzwords**—words or phrases that are popular for a period of time or in a particular industry. In today’s job market, buzzwords like data-driven, team player, and self-starter are common. You may see terms like these show up throughout your searches.

Similarly, many job descriptions list the specific skills they require candidates to have. These skills can become some of the terms that you use in your job search. Examples of these skills include:

- **Coordination,** or getting people and teams to work together. You may see responsibilities in job descriptions such as “coordination of efforts to achieve project deliverable” or “coordinate internal resources to ensure successful project completion.” Being a project manager is essentially managing the coordination of resources to achieve your end goal. Coordination is one of the top skills a project manager should have, so searching for this term can lead you to appropriate positions.

- **Organization,** or the ability to stay focused on different tasks. You may come across phrases like “solid organizational skills, including attention to detail and multitasking skills” or something as simple as “highly organized.” Organization is key to being a great project manager. We will discuss many ways to sharpen this skill in the upcoming lessons.

Then we learned that project management is alive in nearly every industry and company. So you're working on an incredibly useful and versatile certification. We also learned what a project is: A unique endeavor and temporary pursuit, carefully planned out to achieve a particular goal. Hopefully by now, you're familiar with the idea that every project has a defined time frame, cost, scope, and dedicated resources. We've covered some broad concepts and key terms that will help you become a successful project manager, and we've gone over how to search for jobs when that time comes. We've also discussed how to effectively translate your past experiences into talking points for why you'll be a successful project manager. We talked about how you can transfer skills from your previous job into your new project management role, and how that'll really set you apart. Everything from juggling a to-do list to budgeting for a loved one's birthday party demonstrates that you probably already have some of the skills to be a phenomenal project manager. But no worries if you don't. We're starting from scratch here. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills, but also the experience, and knowledge to find the role you want.

## WEEK 2

## Exploring how a Project Manager adds value

### Introduction: Becoming an effective Project Manager

You will learn how project managers add value to organizations and to their teams, what the role and responsibilities of a project manager entail, and what core skills a project manager needs to be successful.

#### Learning Objectives

- Detail the core skills to be a successful project manager.
- Describe the role and day-to-day responsibilities of a project manager.
- Discuss when and why it is necessary to have a project manager.

Let's start by reviewing what we've discussed so far. Earlier, you were introduced to project management as a career path. We discussed how this course can help you advance your career goals with a project management certification. We also discussed some of the basics of project management, like how to define a project and its different components. Then, we went over some distinct project management careers, roles, and responsibilities. Now it's time to gain a deeper understanding of a project manager's role. By the end of this module, you'll be able to explain the unique value a project manager brings to their team. You'll also be able to describe a project manager's roles and responsibilities, and list their core skills. This course will help you continue to recognize the skills that you already have that will help you become a successful project manager. It will also help you identify new skills that you may need to learn in preparation for your new career.

### The value of a Project Manager

Earlier in this course, we introduced you to the world of project management. We discussed how project management spans industries and companies of all kinds, from large corporations to small businesses. Now let's define what a project manager is and describe how they add value to their teams and organizations. Let's start with the definition. Project managers shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as guides for their team, using their impeccable organizational and interpersonal skills every step of the way. As you learned earlier, project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved time-frame. We'll dig deeper into these topics throughout this program. What you need to know right now is that project managers play a crucial role in their organizations. Project managers add value to their teams and organizations in key ways that include prioritization, delegation, and effective communication. So let's break these down. First, we'll discuss prioritization. Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through effective prioritization of tasks required to complete a project. They're experts at helping team members identify and break down large tasks into smaller steps. There'll be times when a project manager may not know which task to prioritize. To determine which ones are the most critical to the success of the project, they'll connect with their teams and with stakeholders to gather information and make a plan. Stakeholders are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success, like the leader of an organization. You've probably used prioritization to complete work in the past. In any kind of project, personal or professional, there are tasks with different levels of priority. For example, let's imagine that you've decided to rent a house and plan to repaint the rooms. You've picked out your paint and you're eager to get started. While it may be tempting to start painting right away, you'll need to prioritize tasks like laying out drop cloths to protect the floors and furniture, applying blue tape to the rooms' edges, and much more. Those preliminary steps are critical and need to come before painting. Other related steps, like choosing new face plates for your light switches, can come later in the process or be switched out of the project entirely if you run out of time or money. When you choose to take care of these preliminary steps before wedging open the paint can, you're prioritizing the tasks or steps of your project. You're also increasing the likelihood that you'll be satisfied with your newly-painted rooms. This process is similar for professional projects. When you effectively prioritize important tasks, you set up your team and yourself for a better project outcome. Now, let's discuss delegation. Project managers use delegation to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work. Let's return to our house painting example for a second here. Painting multiple rooms can be a time-consuming project, so it's possible that you might enlist a few friends to help you get it done. Maybe one friend has professional painting experience. Now, with that in mind, you might ask her to handle the more challenging aspects of the project, like painting the ceiling or the detailed molding. You might also schedule her to paint the molding before another friend paints the walls. So by delegating this task to the person with the right skills to complete the work and ordering the task appropriately, you're applying knowledge of your team's strengths to the planning of your project. That makes sense, right? Finally, let's talk about effective communication. Project managers deliver value through effective communication, both with their team and with key stakeholders. This refers to being transparent, which means being up front with plans and ideas and making information readily available. Project managers keep in regular contact with their team about the progress of the work and help identify areas where a teammate may need support. In our house painting example, this might involve checking in with your friends periodically to ask if they have enough paint or supplies left to complete their tasks. Checking in regularly means you'll know if you need to buy more paint before the can is empty, which ensures that the project stays on track. In addition to keeping up with teammates, project managers keep in regular contact with people outside of the team, like company leaders who are invested in the project outcomes. For example, you might reach out to your landlord to get permission to paint and to share the days you'll be working on this project. Though your landlord isn't directly involved in the project's execution, the outcomes will affect her property and so it's important to keep her informed. Without your project management skills, you might run out of paint halfway through the project, your walls might get painted without drop cloths to protect the floors, and your landlord could be caught off guard about your plans. So it's a good thing you're here to keep the project running smoothly and efficiently. Great. Now you should be able to define what a project manager is and explain how they use prioritization, delegation, and effective communication to deliver value to their organizations. Coming up, you'll hear about the career path of a real life project manager at Google. Their journey to me is fascinating and we can't wait to share it with you.

### JuAnne: Path to becoming a Project Manager

My name is JuAnne. I'm a Senior Program Manager at Google. I'm a first-generation Chinese American. My family and I came to the United States when I was young. My parents worked really hard when I was growing up and I spent a lot of time by myself, basically just having to take care of myself; planning my meals, doing my homework, taking care of chores. I feel like I got a little bit of my program management skills from just being really organized, having to be really organized all the time. My path to being a project manager really started as a business systems analyst. I was writing requirements or gathering requirements for our customers and translating them into documentation for our engineers so that they could implement it. Through that process, I became a project manager. I started to manage the timelines, manage the tasks, understand all the pieces, and who needed to be involved. There you go, you have a project manager. I think the funnest part about being a project manager is really working with people. You get to meet all different kinds of people, different personalities. Sometimes you get to travel to places to meet them but even when you don't, just meeting new people and understanding how we interact, how people interact and behave is fascinating. I think if you build a relationship, focus on the relationship, and really understand what their style, where they're coming from, what their concerns are, it will help your working relationship much better. You can communicate with them in the style that's necessary. You can work with them in the style that's more receptive to them and that would just make the project better all around.

### How Project Managers impact organizations

You have learned that project managers can prioritize, delegate, and effectively communicate to deliver value to their projects. This reading will focus on the main ways that project managers can add value to projects and impact organizations, which include:

- Focusing on the customer
- Building a great team
- Fostering relationships and communication
- Managing the project
- Breaking down barriers

![Focusing](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gDsnaaA9Qju7J2mgPRI7uw_44e1b4346b6f46b1b75b357a808399f0_BpBtbq8hRtqQbW6vIXbagw_cc2fe37c90734d0994a9c7b51985d86c_Focusing.png?expiry=1659571200000&hmac=mtW_CWnpfX4pfOW_LAI1n70pJVlvfm--TrLnX9Na0Rs)

Customers are always a key element to success in any business. There is no exception to that in the field of project management. In project management, the word “customer” refers to a person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as budget and deadlines. In projects, customers can be internal or external. Internal customers are stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments. External customers are customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers.

To successfully deliver a project, it has to meet the customer’s standards. To meet the customer’s standards, you have to make sure you clearly understand their expectations. The customer is at the center of a successful project. Project managers can add a lot of value to the project by building relationships with customers and taking the time to make sure the customer is heard and satisfied with the result.

#### Asking the customer questions

Let’s discuss how you can focus on the customer in a project. First, sit with the customer and ask what problem they are trying to solve. You might ask if they have a specific vision of the final outcome they would like delivered. Sometimes, customers will lean on project managers to find the solution to their problem. It’s your job to ask questions like:

- What is the problem you would like us to help solve? Example response: The customer wants help developing a new process that would allow their company to be more efficient.

- How is the problem impacting your organization? Example response: The customer states that they are losing clients because of their current inefficient processes since clients are sometimes receiving their orders late.

- What prompted you to ask for help now? Example response: The customer says that they may lose department funding if they do not improve efficiency.

- What is your hope for the outcome of this project? Example response: The customer states that their ultimate goal is to increase the speed at which they fill orders without sacrificing quality.

Taking the time to dig a little deeper into the “why” behind the project can help a project manager better support and understand the customer. The more you understand the customer’s goals, the more likely you will be able to produce what the customer is seeking.

![3F4e_CZtRfCeHvwmbQXwlA_ab87ef4538c549c0ba9316b87d292499_Building](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/3F4e_CZtRfCeHvwmbQXwlA_ab87ef4538c549c0ba9316b87d292499_Building.png?expiry=1659571200000&hmac=LH1Muj_Igoi5yoUGanqGTjIQQAtO8PQsAtPtKJuvADM)

The team is a project’s biggest asset. A successful project manager knows that and takes the time to understand each person’s motivations, strengths, and weaknesses. Project managers add value to the project by identifying the right team for the project and enabling the team to be successful and make decisions.

When you work to build a great team, you have to consider the skills needed for the project, as well as the resources available. Understanding the customer’s requirements helps shape the skills needed for your team. If you are working on a project that requires people with medical expertise and you hire people who do not have a medical background, no matter how hard that team works, they will not have the right skill set to complete the project. As project manager, you should bring on people with the right skills and ensure the team knows that each individual is valued, trusted, and appreciated. You can demonstrate how you feel about the team’s value by allowing them to have input and ask questions, and by addressing their needs as soon as possible.

![wElcha82RcCJXIWvNgXAUA_2f5c4ac359fa4a5e87b9ca3f7c558db7_C1M2L1R1_C](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wElcha82RcCJXIWvNgXAUA_2f5c4ac359fa4a5e87b9ca3f7c558db7_C1M2L1R1_C.png?expiry=1659571200000&hmac=e1yiQ-r7C8_Kq6tjgqKow_k-Ass5pAgrVPFBkyuycoA)

Maintaining customer satisfaction and building a great team are two ways that you, as a project manager, can add value to a project. Both of these skills are built on the foundation of relationships and communication. The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.

Project managers can set the tone for a project and build relationships within their teams and with stakeholders. Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.

![Jx-ufnjbR_afrn5423f2bg_44d097e3a85048a5b010b0e3d3b6eb32_Manage](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Jx-ufnjbR_afrn5423f2bg_44d097e3a85048a5b010b0e3d3b6eb32_Manage.png?expiry=1659571200000&hmac=xmtmUPLMyRuElOB-XK-RT8pS_LJ8gGEX-03Lv_DYXDI)

When you build teams, each person is generally assigned specific project tasks. Once each task is done, the person responsible for that task hands that part of the project over to the next person. Your team members don’t always see the whole picture and how they impact others in a project. A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product. For example, if a graphic designer working on marketing materials for your project doesn't understand the customer’s overall goal to appeal to educators, they may not be able to fully capture the vision for the campaign. Helping this team member understand the big picture allows them to tailor their tasks to meet the needs of the project end goal.

Managing a project can be busy, but if you take the time to build relationships and maintain open lines of communication, you will increase the chances of the project’s success as well as the customer’s and your team members’ satisfaction.

![SVUd4_SfT32VHeP0n599Hg_59aec878ab3546ae922bef99b4dbf88e_barriers](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SVUd4_SfT32VHeP0n599Hg_59aec878ab3546ae922bef99b4dbf88e_barriers.png?expiry=1659571200000&hmac=HH315PS8LVVzyC6sKvA3Wmi3MF-Jokogo0KbwDCciDg)

Sometimes, when you ask why something is being done a certain way, the response you get is, “Because we’ve always done it this way.” A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share ideas. As a project manager, you have to model ingenuity and collaboration, and encourage your team to do the same.

How can you break down barriers on a project? You can provide support for your team as they try new approaches to find solutions, and you can advocate for additional resources for your team. If your team is having a hard time getting an answer from another organization, you can reach out to the organization yourself in order to keep the team on track and on schedule.

### Key takeaway

You have now learned some of the ways that project managers can add value to projects and impact organizations. By focusing on the customer, building a great project team, fostering relationships and communication, managing the project, and breaking down barriers, you can overcome obstacles and find solutions to succeed.

## Learning more about Project Manager roles and responsibilities

### Key project manager roles and responsibilities

I hope you enjoyed that last story because for me, it's always helpful to hear about someone else's career path. Maybe you even noticed a few parallels between their career path and your own, or you felt inspired to pursue a specific area of project management. So far we've discussed the types of project management roles you'll be qualified for, and how to search for them. Earlier, we discussed the value that project managers bring to their teams and their organizations. Now let's learn more about the roles and responsibilities of a project manager. Earlier you learned that project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. How does that actually happen? That's where you come in. Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs, and other factors, so that the project can be completed within the approved budget and time-frame. Let's break these down into examples of responsibilities that you might find in a job listing for a project management role. We'll start with planning and organizing. One responsibility that falls under the umbrella of planning and organizing is making use of productivity tools and creating processes. During the planning and execution of a project, you might need to use certain tools and develop processes to improve information sharing across the team; you may also need to create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project. The next task is budgeting and controlling costs, and other factors. As the project is underway, changes to the plan and budget are bound to come up. Believe me. This will require you to monitor and manage the budget, track issues and risks as they arise, and manage quality by mitigating those issues and risks. One way to do this is by removing unforeseen barriers that come up. Now, by barriers, we mean things that can get in the way of project progress. For example, if your teammates lack the resources needed to complete a task, you might identify that issue, or barrier upfront, escalate the issue to a stakeholder, and work to secure the resource so your team can move forward. Another huge piece of the project manager's role is managing tasks. A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your stakeholders. Keeping track of tasks is a great way to help manage the team's workload and ensure that things are getting done. Keeping track of tasks is also a great tool for demonstrating progress to people outside the immediate team, like your stakeholders. Back when I was a program manager in Student Development here at Google, one of our goals was to create pathways for students who identify with communities that are underrepresented in the technology industry. A large part of my day-to-day responsibilities involved working with two separate engineering teams to create our technical curriculum. To manage the tasks associated with this project, I created separate project trackers for each team that outline the vision for the curriculum. These trackers kept both teams in the loop about the timeline for delivery, the categories and subcategories for work, and the team members assigned to each task, I also made sure to update our stakeholders every step of the way. By actively managing tasks through out the project lifecycle, I was able to keep tabs on everyone's work and efficiently inform stakeholders, which allowed us to achieve our project goal with minimal issues. Nice job. Now you should be able to describe the roles and responsibilities of a project manager. Coming up, we'll discuss a project manager's role within the extended team, including how to work alongside the people tasked with executing the project.

### Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills

**What are the core job responsibilities of project managers?** Let’s recap what we learned in the previous video.

The project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs, and other factors to help keep the project within budget and on time.

What does that mean? Basically, as the project manager, you will be responsible for tracking the day-to-day details of the project, but you will also have an opportunity to step back and see the bigger picture of the overall project.

Depending on the project and organization, you may also have responsibilities that utilize your interpersonal skills. **Interpersonal skills** are the behaviors you use to interact with others, such as communication, active listening, and leadership.

Let's review these responsibilities.

![kZ70EGixT7ae9BBosa-2Qw_ed45fc8ca4cd4c9c92591dd707e3dcd0_Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-11.26.04-AM](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kZ70EGixT7ae9BBosa-2Qw_ed45fc8ca4cd4c9c92591dd707e3dcd0_Screen-Shot-2021-02-25-at-11.26.04-AM.png?expiry=1659571200000&hmac=vGguq9SXyPJzDH5yOTs_Nyv-CkLgAlMKFRliNbplOFs)

#### Teaching and mentoring

As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

#### Building relationships

Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to check in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

#### Controlling change

The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team.

#### Empowering your team

We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.

#### Communicating status and concerns

As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

#### Key takeaway

You have learned that project managers may be responsible for teaching and mentoring project team members, building relationships with the team and various stakeholders, controlling change and the impact to the project, empowering team members to make decisions, and communicating status and potential concerns. These interpersonal responsibilities can be just as important to the success of your projects as your more concrete responsibilities, like scheduling and budgeting.

As you continue through this course, you will learn more about how these project manager responsibilities are embedded into the different phases of a project.

### A Project Manager’s role within a team

Earlier you learned more about the responsibilities of a project manager. And while it might seem like a lot to keep track of, it's important to know that you, as the project manager won't need to do everything on your own. Let's discuss the role of the project manager and how that role relates to other roles within the project team. It's easier to hear the term manager and immediately think of your boss. But a project manager is not often the direct manager of the people working on a project team. Here, we're discussing the project manager as someone who manages the tasks of a project. But what does that really mean, right? Well, although you might have a few teammates working with you on a project, you're probably not their day-to-day boss. With the help of your team, you can get a lot more done together. Everyone on your team will have their own set of roles and responsibilities. And you'll come together to ensure that everyone is able to do their part to advance the project. Each person will be an expert on their portion of the project, but no one will be an expert on every aspect of the project, and honestly, neither will you. For instance, the graphic designer will focus on graphic design, but probably won't be an expert on copywriting. Similarly, you'll be an expert on project management, but may not be an expert on marketing. Here's another way to think about it. Imagine that you're organizing a camping trip. You might be the person in charge of planning the trip, but that doesn't mean you have to be a camping expert. Maybe you've never been camping before, but your partner grew up spending every summer by the campfire. In that case, you might assign them the task of picking out the right number and style of tents for your group. So, in this example, you are planning the trip by giving your partner the job of finding the right number of tents and the right size tents to make sure everyone is covered. You aren't doing the research or the task yourself, but you're making sure that things are getting done. It's similar in the workplace. As the project manager, you won't be an expert in every project role, and that's okay. As we said, your job isn't to be the expert on everything. Instead you're responsible for guiding your team and making sure that they have the support that they need in order to complete the project. So how does a project manager go about doing that? Let's discuss using a few more examples of the required responsibilities you might find in a job listing. First, you'll need to hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks. Managing tasks will help you hold your team members accountable by giving them ownership over specific pieces of the project. Second, you'll need to ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and be able to establish escalation paths. Now by escalation paths, I mean that you should know how you will communicate risks to the right people at the right time. Third, you'll need to understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles. As the project manager, you'll likely have the best idea of which style is best for the work. It's your job to ensure that the team adheres to that style and the other systems in place. And fourth, you'll need to collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget. In other words, a project may affect not only your team, but other teams at an organization, as well as, say, the marketing or the finance team. So you'll need to work with those teams to ensure that everyone is happy with the project outcomes. You'll learn more about working with other stakeholders in a later course. Catch all that? Let's recap. You learned that a project manager isn't always the direct manager of each member of the project team. Rather, they're responsible for guiding those people and ensuring they have the support they need to complete the project. Now that you have a good sense of the way that a project manager fits into the project team, let's move a little bit ahead, where we'll discuss the types of skills that a project manager needs to succeed.

### Working with cross-functional teams

As a project manager, you will likely work with **cross-functional teams**. A cross-functional team includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions. Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project.

Sometimes the members of a cross-functional team are referred to as “T-shaped professionals.” They are skilled in how to collaborate and innovate with those in different job functions and across different departments, but they also contribute their own specific areas of expertise. Each member of a cross-functional team has their own unique perspective and experience, bringing different ideas and strategies to the project.

Let’s explore each of these ideas in more detail.

#### Clarify goals

When working with cross-functional teams, it is important to ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project. It is vital to set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals. Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources. Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information. It will be up to you to continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work. Cross-functional teams may work in different departments, be in different physical locations, and have different leadership, but all team members work together with the project manager to support the current project. Your project may be competing against other priorities, so communicating clearly and often with your team—and vice versa—helps you identify any potential issues or concerns before they arise.

#### Get team members with the right skills

Making sure you have team members with the correct skill sets for each of the project functions is critical. If you are building an airplane and you’ve got five engineers but no mechanics, you are missing a key element of your cross-functional team. As the project manager, you must help ensure that your team has the right people with the right skill sets needed for the project to succeed. Later in this program, we will discuss some tools you can use to help you identify the skill sets needed to accomplish your project tasks.

#### Measure progress

Showing your team how much they have accomplished helps keep them motivated. Take the time to measure and communicate the project’s progress across the cross-functional team. This helps everyone see the full picture and recognize their impact on the project. You can measure progress in many ways, including meeting key milestones, completing project tasks, and meeting project goals on time and within budget. Regularly communicate with your team members to check on their progress. Ask them if they anticipate being finished on time. If not, ask how you can help them succeed. Keep track of the team’s progress throughout the project by documenting when tasks and goals are completed, and let your team members know if the project is on track or not. Make sure you communicate successes, delays, or issues, to the team so they know how the project is progressing. Keeping everyone informed is essential to the project’s success.

#### Recognize efforts

Sometimes, when you work with cross-functional teams, there are certain skills that get recognized more than others. A mechanic could get accolades for coming up with the solution to a problem within the project, while the finance member who sourced the funding might be forgotten. As a project manager, it is your job to make sure that each member of your cross-functional team recognizes the value of their efforts each step of the way. You have learned the importance of building relationships with stakeholders, and building relationships with your cross-functional team members is just as important. Learning what makes your team members feel supported, giving and taking feedback, and being mindful of each individual's background, personal identifiers, and work style can help mediate some of the differences among team members.

#### Key takeaway

Being able to communicate clearly with team members, clarify the goals of the project, get team members with the right skills, measure team progress, and recognize team members’ efforts is an important part of your role as the project manager, and is key to your project’s success.

### Elita: A day in the life of a project manager

A great project manager is some funky combination of EMT, ninja, and jazz musician. An EMT who can show up on a scene that's full of chaos, figure out what needs to happen now, triage all of the things on site, and then develop a plan of action while also participating in that action. A ninja, because you have to be stealth about how you go about influencing other people. Overt action or pushing people too hard isn't necessarily received well. A jazz musician, particularly a jazz drummer, who keeps a steady beat as a lot of things are happening around you. On a team, you're going to be surrounded by a bunch of talented people. A trombone player, a bass player, a trumpet player, a pianist, and you, keeping the beat and making sure that everybody is working in time. I spend most of my days with my product and engineering counterparts talking a lot about strategy, updating status to key stakeholders, and trying to figure out what comes next for our product. Some things about my job never change from this day to my very first day. The fact that I communicate with a lot of people in a day, a lot of different types of people, from engineers to product managers to partnerships, to sales and marketing, all of that's the same. The biggest difference is the number of people that I communicate with, and the complexity of the topics I cover. The most important thing for you to keep in mind is staying organized. The more organized you are in your actions, the more organized your team is in their thinking and their actions. What I do to stay organized is lists, all day long. I have post-it notes, I have electronic lists, I have lists in e-mails, and those lists help me stay on top of what actions need to happen now, what actions need to happen next, and which I can put off for a few more days. I do use lists to help manage my time. I think one of the things my lists are most important for is making sure I know what needs to be done today. Then, once my list is made and I'm sure of what needs to be done today, I budget time for those things. A stand-up is a quick meeting, usually at the start of the day, but you can have them at any time. My stand-ups usually happened in the morning around 9:30 or 10:00 o'clock, depending on when the engineering team got in. They lasted for about 15 minutes so that we were clear on what had gotten done the day before and what was on the docket to get done today. Then we usually checked in again quickly around lunch to make sure that people were still on track or ran into any technical issues that might require a longer time to finish the task. I think the thing that makes me a great project manager is a bias to action and resilience. One of my favorite phrases, is pick it and stick it. In part because I think it's important to make a decision to get yourself unstuck, to follow through on that action, learn some things and decide to take a new action once you've learned something. The latter half of that is resilience. I'm resilient and my teams are resilient. If we've taken a bad action, we've learned that we can learn and change our mind with new information. I'm Elita, a Senior Engineering Program Manager at Google.

## Acquiring the core skills of a successful Project Manager

### The core skills of a project manager

Now that you've learned about the roles and responsibilities of a project manager, let's discuss the core skill sets that a project manager should bring to the role. While there are lots of different skills a project manager can bring to their role, there are four specific skill sets that we think can help a project manager be successful. Those are enabling decision-making, communicating and escalating, flexibility, and strong organizational skills. First, let's talk about enabling decision-making. The ability to enable decision-making on the team, or gathering decisions from the appropriate leader, is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals. Lots of the day-to-day decisions within a project will likely fall to you and your teammates to discuss and agree on. You'll ensure that projects stay on schedule by gathering information from teammates and using those insights to help the team make informed decisions. You'll also make sure that those decisions are communicated to the necessary coworkers, whether that's the immediate team or company leaders. For example, you might provide relevant data or feedback to help your teammates make an informed decision between choice A and choice B. The second skill is communicating and escalating. As a project manager, you'll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. This might look like documenting plans, sending emails about the status of the project, or holding a meeting to escalate risks or issues to stakeholders. The third skill is flexibility. As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans definitively will change, even with careful upfront planning. For example, maybe the goals of your company change, or maybe a member of your team unexpectedly takes a new position at another company. A good project manager knows that unpredictable moments like these are almost always guaranteed. A quote we love here at Google is, "The only constant is change," and that's true. By staying cool under pressure, you'll be able to adjust while helping your team stay calm, too. Finally, a successful project manager needs strong organizational skills. As you learned earlier, the role of a project manager requires using a lot of different processes to keep the project on track. Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize these processes and the core elements of a project to ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked, which trust me, can and does happen. To prevent this, you might decide to track daily tasks in a spreadsheet or send frequent status updates or reminders. There are many ways to stay organized and hone your organizational skills, and we'll talk more about them throughout the program. To recap, decision-making, communicating and escalating, flexibility, and strong organizational skills are four core skill sets that are essential to successful project management. You can continue to build on these skills by becoming familiar with industry knowledge that applies to most project management roles. Knowledge of helpful tools and templates and familiarity with popular project management styles like Waterfall and Agile, can help you organize and document the project throughout its lifecycle. We'll learn about these throughout this program. Hopefully, you feel better equipped to explain the core skills a project manager should bring to the role. These skills really help enforce team morale and accountability for the tasks of a project. We'll discuss this coming up.

### Key competencies: Flexibility and handling ambiguity

In the previous video, we discussed the four key competencies of a project manager: **enabling decision-making, communicating and escalating, strong organizational skills, and flexibility.** With time and practice, you will master these skills to help you become successful in a project management role. In this reading, we’ll dig deeper into why **flexibility** is essential for effective project management and how you can help your team deal with **ambiguity**.

First, let’s review the other project management competencies you’ve learned about so far.

#### Enabling decision-making

You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness.

#### Communicating and escalating

Project management requires clearly communicating project goals and expectations, team member roles and responsibilities, and constructive feedback. Knowing how to effectively communicate and when to escalate issues to management is key to keeping you, your team, and your organization on the path to success. When escalation is required, try to approach management with both the problem and the potential solution or suggestions. This will show that you’re taking initiative as a project manager.

#### Strong organizational skills

If you demonstrate that it is important for you, as a leader, to stay organized through efficient tracking and communications, your team will follow suit. One way to do this is by utilizing the abundance of organizational tools available, such as:

- Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)

- Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)

- Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)

- Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)

You may need to experiment with different organizational approaches to determine what works best for you and your team.

#### Flexibility

All project managers need the ability to adapt and overcome changes and challenges. Let’s further explore why flexibility is such a critical project management skill and discuss how it can help prepare your team for change, mitigate risks, and handle ambiguity.

**Flexible planning**

Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability:

- **Assess external constraints.** When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.

- **Plan for risks and challenges.** If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly. We will discuss risk management at length later in this program.

- **Calculate “float” in your schedule.** Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. Identifying float in your schedule can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track. You will learn more about calculating float in a later course, when we discuss creating a critical path for your project tasks.

**Handling ambiguity**

Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity:

- **Keep calm.** In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same.

- **Express empathy.** As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.

- **Communicate what you know clearly.** Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.

- **Make decisions and stick to them.** Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team.

- **Trust the expertise of your team.** Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information.

#### Key takeaway

As a project manager, having the flexibility and ability to handle ambiguity in a rapidly-changing business setting gives you an advantage. Mastering these competencies, along with enabling decision-making, effective communication skills, and strong organizational skills, will allow you to innovate and grow as a project manager and leader.

### Rachel: My journey to becoming a Project Manager

My name is Rachel, I'm a Senior Program Manager in Google, New York. Google hired me out of a bar in the East Village about 12 years ago. For about three years, a group of NY Ops and SRE, drank at my bar. Like everyone at the bar, they asked the bartender for advice. I gave them advice and helped them through a lot of problems, and I also became friends with them. I really admired them, they were incredibly smart and charming and really good drinkers, and tippers. Eventually, I wanted something different for my life. I've been standing behind a bar all night long, and there was an opportunity to apply for an admin role in their team. So, I joined Google in 2008. They hired me first as an Administrator for Site Reliability and Engineering Ops in New York City. After about two years, I transferred into Program Management. Google's hiring is a little more conventional now, but the skills that I polished while being a bartender informed my everyday work. A wise old bartender that I knew in the lower East side once told me that, "A bar was a room full of tables and chairs and some beer, and a meeting room was the same, a room full of tables and chairs. People come into a bar like they come into a meeting room wanting to leave feeling something else." As a program manager, my job was to help people through that experience, the aesthetic experience of meeting with each other, making decisions, and coming to conclusions together. Very similar to bartending and helping people have a better night. My role as a program manager started by someone taking a risk on me. My engineering partner picked me out of the admin pool because he knew that I could build a community with these engineers. When you work in a bar, you have to talk to anyone who comes into the bar. Anyone who walks through that door is your customer. You have to understand what they want, what they want to drink, whether they can continue drinking, whether they might be done drinking, all of these things. When you are working with a subject matter expert, an engineer, a product designer, a UX person, the same things apply. You have to be able to talk to any engineer on your team, any product manager you need to work with, and you have to understand their unique needs. Program Management isn't just about the process and the artifacts that you create, it's about how you relate to people. Understanding what you've learned in other parts of your life, whether it was in a bar or art school, these are the experiences that you bring into the job that make your work unique. Your skills, talking to people or de-escalating conflict or understanding what people need. This is what makes you a great program manager.

### Common myths about Project Managers

We have talked about the skills that project managers need to be successful in their role. Now, let’s debunk some of the common myths about what is needed to be an effective project manager.

#### Myth: You have to be an expert in the field and have a lot of technical knowledge about the project.

**Reality:** There are benefits to the project manager not having a lot of technical knowledge about a project. Rather than getting caught up in the technical details when communicating with management and stakeholders, the project manager can look at all of the different pieces that the cross-functional team is working on and assess how they each contribute to the success of the project. As a project manager, you bring on the right team members—with their differing areas of expertise—and trust them to be able to focus on the technical aspects of the project. Your job is to handle the communication, documentation, and organization necessary to get the project successfully to the finish line.

**Scenario:** Jamar just landed his first project management job with a construction company. He’s been tasked with managing the construction of a new elementary school in his city. He isn’t expected to know how to do all of the technical skills, like engineering, construction, plumbing, and electrical; he hires the right people for the job. He communicates the needs, timelines, and expectations of the project to his team members and stakeholders and helps break down any barriers to completing the project on time. Jamar helps the engineers and construction workers communicate with one another to ensure that they are all on the same page regarding the requirements. He makes sure that the materials are in place as needed for the plumbers and electricians.

**The bottom line:** Project managers hire the experts and help put all the pieces of the project together. Project managers don’t need to be experts in every field.

#### Myth: Only people with a lot of experience within an organization can manage projects successfully.

**Reality:** It is a common misconception that anyone who has significant experience and success in an organization can manage projects there. In order to successfully manage projects in any organization, you must acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, tools, and techniques and be able to apply them. You don’t necessarily need to have worked in previous roles at that organization. In taking this certification, you are learning and practicing how to be an effective project manager before taking on a position.

**Scenario:** Sofia is a supervisor at a large customer service call center. She has been recognized by leadership as a top performer. To reward her, management has offered her the role of project manager for the implementation of a new call center software program. It will be her job to oversee the installation, training, and implementation of the new process. Sofia tries to manage the project, but she has no idea how to create a project plan, manage the various members of her team, identify risks, or handle any of the other major project management tasks. She lets her manager know that she does not have the appropriate training to manage the project but that she would like to build those skills. Sofia’s manager enrolls her in a project management training course so that she will have the necessary skills to manage projects in the future.

**The bottom line:** To be a successful project manager at any organization—regardless of whether you have worked there previously—it is essential to master the skills, tools, and techniques of project management.

#### Myth: You have to know every single detail about the project at all times.

**Reality:** Details matter in project execution, but as a project manager, you must also focus on the big picture and strategy for the project. What is the end goal? Do you and your team have a clear direction? If the whole team understands their objectives and has what they need to be successful in their tasks, they can work on the individual details and provide you space to supervise the overall project goals. Open lines of communication will help ensure that your team members share any possible risks to the budget or schedule with you.

**Scenario:** Yui is a project manager working for a clothing company. The company is developing a new line of winter sleepwear that is set to launch in late October. Yui meets with the key stakeholders to determine their goals and timeline for the project. She recruits employees from the merchandising, exports, marketing, materials, production, and quality control departments to be a part of the project team. Yui meets with her team at the start of the project to clarify the objectives for the product line and checks in with them regularly to remove any barriers and find out where they need additional support. When a team member from the materials department informs Yui that the fabric they were planning on using for a particular style of pajamas has increased in price, Yui works with the team member to find a new supplier so that the overall project budget is not impacted.

**The bottom line:** Your role as a project manager is to communicate with your stakeholders, clarify objectives, and set expectations. Trust your team to handle the details of each project task and communicate with you when there’s an issue. Through your direct communication and strategic approach to problem-solving, you can provide solutions and help remove barriers for your team. This is where you add value!

We have just busted three project management myths! Recognizing these truths will help you be more confident and successful as you pursue your project manager career.

### Leadership and team dynamics

Earlier, you learned about the role of the project manager and the core skills you'll need to be successful in that role. You've also learned more about your role within the project team. Now let's discuss a few key skills that you'll use to build relationships with your teammates and stakeholders. Using your interpersonal skills is key to building relationships with the people involved in your project. By developing these relationships, you'll learn about the needs and concerns of the team. This will help you determine the priorities of the project and motivate your team throughout the process. Possessing strong interpersonal skills is a huge part of good leadership. Even if you've never held a formal leadership position, having these skills will help you when you need to guide a team. This is called influencing without authority, which refers to a project manager's ability to guide teammates to complete their assigned work without acting as their direct managers. There's a few key interpersonal skills that you can use to accomplish this and guide the project outcomes, even without the authority of being your teammates' boss. These skills include communication, negotiation, conflict mediation, and understanding motivations. Let's break these down. First step is a key skill we've mentioned a few times now, communication. In the context of leading a team, communication can include checking in with teammates to understand how they're progressing on a task and providing clear feedback on the quality of a teammate's work. Next is negotiation. Negotiation might include working with a teammate to compromise on a new deadline when they tell you that they won't be able to complete their work on time. Now, trust me, I know this can be frustrating, but you'll need to use your negotiation skills often with your teammates and stakeholders to balance their needs and what is best for the project. Another important skill is conflict mediation. As we mentioned, project plans can change and issues will arise. This can sometimes lead to tension and conflict within the team. Conflict mediation is a great skill to practice and develop to ensure the project does not suffer as a result. This might involve setting up a meeting with two teammates who are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task. Finally, there's understanding motivations. This means getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to do their best work. Understanding motivations might also include learning how your teammates prefer to receive feedback, and how they like to receive recognition for doing a great job. You would use that individualized information to motivate and encourage each person on your team. To recap, communication, negotiation, conflict mediation and understanding motivations are all interpersonal skills that will help you influence without authority. During job interviews for project management positions, you might be asked to discuss a time when you influenced without authority, and it's possible that you've already noticed ways that you've used these skills in your personal life without even realizing it. For example, let's say you have a coworker who's constantly late to every meeting and I mean, every meeting, while you can't force them to arrive on time, it's likely that you've thought about ways to motivate them to want to be on time. In doing so, you might have also wondered how to change the way you communicate with your coworker, to influence them to be on time. Maybe you've tried asking them to arrive 15 minutes earlier than the rest of the group or maybe you've told them how this behavior impacts the rest of the team. Both of these strategies are examples of influencing without authority, and they serve to encourage specific behavior. Influencing without authority is one of the most critical and one of the most challenging aspects of project management. As you've just learned, you'll need to leverage your interpersonal skills in order to do it effectively. In later courses, we'll review and learn more about using your interpersonal skills to manage various projects.

### Ellen: Traits of a successful project manager

I'm Ellen and I'm a director of technical program management. That means I lead a team of program managers at Google. I love project management because I really like this idea that you can do more together as a team with a group of people than you could do alone. By bringing in a bunch of people together and getting organized, getting aligned around a common goal, We can do some pretty amazing things. I think a successful project manager is somebody who really knows how to pull together a group of people. To me, there's really two parts of project management. One is this laser-like focus on executing on this goal, but then the other part is the people. So a successful project manager can do both. When I first started managing project managers, it was really about everyone works on their own project. How do I just guide them, give them guidance and help them with their projects. Over the years, I've shifted to mentoring on project management, to mentoring project managers. What I mean by that is, it's different. I'm no longer saying, "Here's what you should do on your project." I'm really trying to help them think about how to think about their projects. One of the things that I think about a lot as I'm building a project management team is having a really diverse set of folks with different backgrounds, different experiences. We're a global company, so we're really trying to make sure we are a global team as well. When I talk about diversity of background and experience, it really is about working in different types of environments with different types of teams. When I chat with new project managers and they say like, "How do I continue to grow as a project manager?" My answer is, work on different projects, work on as many projects as you can, but don't be afraid to try different areas, different domains, work with different people. With every project you work on, you're going to really learn something.

### Wrap-up

So far, you've started learning all about project managers and the value they bring to their teams. We also introduced you to a few program managers here at Google, who spoke about their own experiences working in the field. You also learned more about the day-to-day responsibilities of a project manager and how they guide their teammates to do their best work. And you learned about the types of skills you'll need to succeed in a program management role. As we move forward, you'll develop and hone lots of the skills needed for the daily tasks of a project manager. And hopefully, you've also identified the skills you already have that can help you become a great project manager and an asset to employers. Next up, we'll discuss the project life cycle. You'll learn more about the different phases of a project and the tasks associated with each phase. You'll also learn more about some of the most popular project management methodologies used across industries today, and how to choose the best one for your project.

## WEEK 3

## Understanding the Project life circle

### Introduction: The project management life cycle and methodologies

Before we move on, let's recap what's already been covered. You learned how to define project management, what a project is, what it isn't, and how to explain its value to businesses. You also discussed when and why it's necessary to have a project manager, the role in day-to-day responsibilities of a project manager, and the core skills needed to be a successful project manager. Now is a good time to stop and recognize how much you've learned. By now you're familiar with the job of project management, and you've started learning what it takes to be an effective project manager. Now you'll go a little further, and learn some of the ins and outs of the job, and before you know it, you'll be ready to guide any project successfully. Are you ready? Well, coming up, I'll introduce you to the two most popular approaches to project management, Waterfall and Agile. We'll also cover the project management life cycle and phases, and you'll learn about the different styles, scenarios, and factors that can impact a project and its tasks at any given phase. When we're done, you'll be able to explain and follow the life cycle of a project, define and outline a project's phases, and each phase's tasks, compare different project management methodologies to determine which methodology is most effective for a project, and finally, organize how a project is run, according to different program management methodologies. Ready? Let's get started.

### Exploring the phases of the project life cycle

No two projects are exactly the same, which means there are many different ways to manage them. Each project comes with its own needs and factors that impact how you'll take action and achieve your goals. There are many ways to manage projects and not always one right way to do so. Picture this, you're project managing a political campaign for a local candidate. To make it happen, you need to think about things like your available resources, the people you'll be working with, the election date, and the location. You need to be aware of lots of details to successfully complete your project. Because so many different things can impact a project, it's important to understand its basic structure. We call this structure the project life cycle. The life cycle is a great way to guide your project in the right direction so that you and your project stay on track and end up in the right place. Most project life cycles have four major phases, each with their own set of tasks and concerns. Check it out. The main phases of a project are initiate the project, make a plan, execute and complete tasks, and finally, close the project. Let's talk about the first phase, initiate the project. This is the launchpad for the entire process of your project. In this phase, you'll define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it. Once the project is approved, it's time to get rolling. Next, you'll make a plan for how you will meet the goals of your project. There are all kinds of ways to plan your project, and we'll get into some different methods and techniques later on. Right now, the important thing to know is that for every single project, creating a plan of how you're going to meet your goals is absolutely 100 percent essential. Think about it. You can't hire a contractor to build a house without planning what it'll look like or how much you have to spend. These same considerations apply to any project that you manage. To be effective, your plan needs to include a lot of things. For example, a budget, a breakdown of all the tasks that you need to be completed, ways to communicate team roles and responsibilities, a schedule, resources, and what to do in case your project encounters problems or needs to change. That's just to name a few. Once you have your plan in place, it's time to execute and complete those tasks. It's important to point out that your project team has the job of completing the project tasks. As a project manager, your role's a little different. While you might be in charge of completing certain tasks in the project, your primary tasks as the project manager are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated. You also remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time. Finally, when all the tasks have been completed, all the resources have been accounted for and the project has crossed the finish line, it's time to close the project. Why is it important to close? One big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work. Closing the project is also a chance to evaluate how the project went. You can make note of what worked and what didn't so you can plan better for next time. Even if the project was a massive success, it's helpful to take time to reflect. Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone outside your team who may have had interest in the project's goal. You can let everyone know what was completed and what you accomplished. Some projects like the campaign example will have a firm end date. Once the project is finished, that's it. There's no more work to do. Other projects have different finish lines. For example, a project where you're implementing a new ordering system at a restaurant is complete after the system is set up and the employees know how it works. At that point, your goals are completed. It's time to hand over the project to another group whose job it is to provide support and make sure the system stays running on a day-to-day basis. Another example of this is, I once project managed the creation of a dashboard that would be used by various stakeholders in my organization. This dashboard would show pertinent information to each stakeholder, depending on the team that they were a part of in our broader organization. I project managed the beginning, from writing up the vision for the project to the end where we delivered the dashboard. Once I passed off the final product, I transitioned the continued update of each team's data and the corresponding dashboard page to the respective teams. Think of it like turning over the keys of a newly built house to its new owner. The project of building the house is complete and now it's up to the owner to take care of the house's maintenance and the upkeep. There you have it. The project life-cycle. The exact name for each phase might change depending on the type of project or organization you work for. The general idea stays the same. Following the project processes you will learn in this course will set you up for project management success. Next, we'll take a closer look into what happens during each phase of the traditional project life cycle.

## Case study: The significance of each project phase

### The consequences of rushing through a project phase

It’s Friday night when Jason, a project manager at a company that specializes in virtual reality software, receives an urgent call from his manager, Mateo. Mateo tells Jason that he needs a cost and timeline for a virtual reality training program for Flight Simulators, Inc., a company that does aircraft maintenance, by the end of the weekend.

Jason spends the weekend working through a proposal for Flight Simulators, Inc. He quickly throws together a proposal estimating that it will cost $200,000 and take six weeks to develop the course. This is the standard cost and time frame for developing training on his company’s platform. He sends the proposal over to Flight Simulators, Inc. so that he can meet their deadline.

When Jason walks into the office on Monday morning, Mateo tells him that he got reprimanded for not following the company’s process for building out a proposal and including the engineers in the process. The engineers take a look at the information presented by Flight Simulators, Inc. and realize that the company’s software won’t work with their platform. It will take six months to develop their platform to meet the needs of the organization’s software and another six months to test the software and platform integration. The cost to develop and test this software will be over a million dollars.

This project has failed before it even started. There’s no way to complete the request from Flight Simulators, Inc. without impacting the budget, quality, and timeline.

**What should have happened**

When his manager calls, Jason tells him that while he understands that Mateo wants to make the customer happy by getting them a proposal promptly, he would like to take a little more time to get the proposal right. Jason tells Mateo that he will draft up an email to Flight Simulators, Inc. and request additional time to develop an accurate and reasonable proposal. Mateo is hesitant but agrees.

On Monday morning, Jason sees that Flight Simulators, Inc. has responded to his request. They appreciate the fact that he communicated his concerns about the quick turnaround on the proposal request. They say they will give him a week to work with his team to provide an estimate for the project.

Now Jason has the time to get all of the key players involved in estimating the effort it will take to complete the project, including the cost, schedule, and resources.

Let’s apply the project life cycle to this project.

![WNTBT-35RiuUwU_t-QYrEg_d32a460cb80c4d09a53dc2751bdfeebf_Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-2.49.06-PM](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WNTBT-35RiuUwU_t-QYrEg_d32a460cb80c4d09a53dc2751bdfeebf_Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-2.49.06-PM.png?expiry=1659830400000&hmac=KruqxhSXIxBjjLk_928AMGHgDCZPvUGx6sC_Hg0Nf-o)

**Initiating the project**

This is the phase Jason rushed through in the first scenario. Ideally, in this phase, Jason discusses project goals with Flight Simulators, Inc. to gain a clear understanding of what they are asking for. Once Jason has defined the project goals, he can gather the stakeholders and project team members to define what needs to be done to successfully create this training for Flight Simulators, Inc. Jason identifies the skill sets required, the timeline, and the cost to develop the training. He identifies and documents the value that this project creates for the company. He presents all of the information he has put together to his company’s leadership team, who approves Jason’s proposal. Jason then submits the proposal to Flight Simulators, Inc., and they accept it.

**Making a plan**

Now that Jason has the green light to work on the project, he makes a project plan to get from start to finish. Having a plan in place ensures that all team members and stakeholders are prepared to complete their tasks. Jason outlines the important deadlines and tasks for the project to be successful. He creates a schedule to account for all resources, materials, and tasks needed to complete the project.

**Executing and completing tasks**

During this project phase, Jason’s project team puts his plan in motion by executing the work. Jason monitors his team as they complete project tasks. His role as the project manager is not to complete the individual tasks but to help break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing their tasks. It is also Jason’s responsibility to communicate schedule and quality expectations. Jason uses his communication skills to keep Flight Simulators, Inc. up to date on the project status and gather feedback from them. This keeps the project on schedule and within budget.

**Closing the project**

Jason’s team has successfully completed the training, and he delivers it to Flight Simulators, Inc. They are very pleased with how it turned out! Jason is now ready to close this project and move on to the next one. Before he closes this chapter, Jason and his team discuss and document the lessons learned from the project. What worked well, and what could work better next time? Jason also puts together a small lunch gathering for his team to celebrate and recognize their hard work.

**Key takeaway**

It may seem like a lot of work to go through an entire project life cycle, but the long-term impact it will have on your project is huge! It is your job as the project manager to make sure that your leadership truly understands the risk of not properly preparing for a project. Making assumptions that are incorrect can put your company at risk. Instead, taking the time to carefully initiate, plan, execute, and close your project leads to project success and good working relationships with customers.

## Analyzing the different Project phases

### Phases in action: Initiating and planning

Now that we've discussed the project life cycle, we're going to explore some of the different tasks that match up with each life cycle phase. But first, let's review the phases. The project life cycle phases are initiate the project, make a plan, execute and complete tasks, and close out the project. Great. Let's get back to the tasks that need to be accomplished during each phase. For this video, we're going to focus on the first two project life cycle phases, initiating the project and making a plan. It's important to call out that the name or tasks for each phase might change, or may be a little different depending on the type of project or the organization where you work. At Google, we use a mix of different project management methods, which you'll learn more about later in the course. But regardless of the method, all projects share a lot of the same tasks needed to get the job done. So, let's get into it. The first step of the project life cycle is to initiate the project. During initiation, you'll organize all of the information you have available to you about your project. This way, when you're ready to continue on, you'll be prepared for the next phase when you can create your plan. Defining project goals makes the details of your project clear so that you and your team can successfully complete the project. For example, if the project goal is to manage a political campaign, then some deliverables, which are specific tasks or outcomes, might be to raise $5,000 or get 500 signatures in support of your candidate's cause. With this in mind, you'll need to do some research to come up with ideas that will help you meet your goals. You'll also need to find out what resources are available. Resources can include people, equipment, software programs, vendors, physical space or locations, and more. Anything you need to actually complete the project is considered a resource. Now as a project manager, you'll record all of these details in your project proposal and then get them approved by a decision maker or group of decision makers at your company so that you can move ahead with your project plans. Now in some cases, you may be the decision maker so be sure to consider the same set of factors when initiating your project before moving to the next stage. No worries, you will learn all the details about how to create a project proposal. We will be getting into more detail of what this is and how to create one later in the course. Voila, once your project is approved, you'll move into the second step of the project life cycle, which is to make a plan. In this phase, you'll create a budget and set the project schedule. You'll establish the project team and determine each person's roles and responsibilities. Let's pause for a second. You may be thinking, "Why can't we just get started?", but that's the thing with project management, deliberate planning is critical to a project's success. A crucial part of project management is planning for risk and change. An experienced project manager knows that plans always change. This ability to adapt is all about thinking and planning ahead. Scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources are just some of the more common types of risks and changes that a project manager needs to consider. So, it's important to keep in mind that planning is key to reducing those risks. But don't worry, if the idea of risks seems a little overwhelming right now, in later courses, we'll teach you all about understanding risks. Just know that it's really important not to skip this step and to always make a plan. Again, the success of your project depends on it. Once you have a plan, you'll communicate all of this information to your team. That way, each member will know which tasks they'll own and what to do if they have questions or if they run into problems. You'll also communicate your plan with others who have an interest in the project success, so that they are aware of your plans and your progress as the project continues to move forward. Nice job, we've made it halfway through the steps of a project life cycle. Up next, we'll check out the remaining two phases, executing and completing tasks and closing the project.

### Phases in action: Executing and closing

We just learned about the core tasks that need to be completed in the first two phases of the project life cycle, initiating the project and making plans. Now, it's time to put your plans into action. Remember, it's not your job to actually do all the tasks. Your primary job as the project manager is to manage the progress of the project as a whole. This means you'll oversee your team's efforts and make sure everyone understands what's expected of them, what tasks need to be done, and how and when to complete those tasks. It's also your job to help remove any obstacles and to alert the right people if it looks like there might be a delay to the project. This means you'll need to communicate with your team, and anyone else involved in your project through meetings, written communications like memos, emails or internal chat tools, and other working documents like task reports. Quick pro tip, if in doubt, err on the side of overcommunication. As your project progresses you'll make adjustments to the schedule, budget, and allocation of resources, clearly communicating updates all along the way. When all the tasks are complete and you've met the project goal, it's time to close the project. This phase is usually overlooked because it's easy to assume that once the project goal has been delivered, everyone can move on. But hold up, there's still a lot that needs to be done. First, check to make sure all tasks have been completed, including any work that was added along the way. Be sure any outstanding invoices have been paid, resources are returned and accounted for, and project documentation has been submitted. Next, and this is very important, get confirmation that the final outcome of your project is acceptable to the people you're delivering it to. It is crucial to your project's success that the person who asked you to manage the project is satisfied with the end result. Once your project has been accepted as meeting its goals, take some time to reflect on what went well and maybe what didn't go so well. This reflection is usually called a retrospective, and it's a chance to note best practices and learn how to manage your project more effectively next time, even if everything went great. The notes from your retrospective are also valuable to the people or organization receiving the end result of the project. That's because they can use that information to inform decisions about their business the next time they consider a project. Now it's time to collect all the project documentation that you created or collected along the way, including all of your plans and reflections, and share the final results of your project with your stakeholders. Remember, stakeholders are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success. Depending on the type of project, stakeholders could include a department or organization's management team, clients or customers of your product or service, users of your new tool or process, or even the community at large if you're planning a community town hall meeting. Pro tip, stakeholders play a huge role in the development, and success of your project. You'll learn a lot more about these key players later on. But for now, just know that they're like the VIPs of your project. Next, take some time to celebrate the effort your team invested in the project. Celebrations help people feel good about the work they've done, and think of the work as uplifting and rewarding because it truly is. Some ideas for small celebrations are a company or team-wide email, thanking the team and acknowledging individual efforts. Now for big projects, you may even consider a company party to celebrate the team and the project success. To wrap up, you and your team can formally move on from the project so that you can pursue new projects in the future. Well, as you can see, being a project manager is a lot of work, but it's very rewarding, and it's all, well, manageable when you follow through with the project life cycle. You can see how the organization, communication, and improvements you add to various areas of a project can make the entire team more effective and efficient, and you can have an impact on many areas of a project in a way that's greater than if you focused on any one task on the project. Similar to a coach with a sports team, even though you aren't actually playing a direct role in the game, your guidance, your communication, and your team-building can make the difference in a happy, high-performing, and successful team. In later courses we'll discuss each of these project phases, and you'll learn methods, techniques, and tools to help you. For now, we just want you to become familiar with the general project management process, and we'll share some of the terms and concepts used in the field that you'll need to know as you develop your project management skills. Up next, we'll introduce you to two of the more popular project methodologies, Waterfall and Agile.

### Summary of the project phases

The **project life cycle** is the path for your project from start to finish. Each project phase builds toward the subsequent phase and helps to create a structure for the project. To recap, the main phases of the project life cycle are: initiating the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and closing the project.

In this reading, we will summarize each phase of the project life cycle.

![pAm6fZ7BQ8yJun2ewQPMXw_5068eb9038304767b5dce8f7ea8f20f5_C1M3L2R1](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pAm6fZ7BQ8yJun2ewQPMXw_5068eb9038304767b5dce8f7ea8f20f5_C1M3L2R1.png?expiry=1659830400000&hmac=6vCjKPunSC0-c5S_NX51lsXxF3U_LOBd3nSFi9s50ww)

**The project life cycle**

**Initiate the project**

- Who are the stakeholders?

- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?

- What is the purpose and mission of the project?

- What are the measurable objectives for the team?

- What is the project trying to improve?

- When does this project need to be completed?

- What skills and resources will the project require?

- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

**Make a plan**

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish.

- Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?

- Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

**Execute the project**

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action.

- Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks.

- Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks.

- Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.

- Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.

- Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

**Close the project**

In this phase, close out the project.

- Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes.

- Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.

- Take time with your team to celebrate your successes!

- Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.

- Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.

- Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

**Key takeaway**

Each phase of the project life cycle has its own significance and reason for existing. By following the project life cycle, you’re ensuring that you are:

- Capturing the expectations of your customer

- Setting your project up for success with a plan

- Executing project tasks and addressing any issues that arise

- Closing out your project to capture any lessons learned.

As you continue through this course, we will walk through each project phase in more detail.

## Comparing Project Management methodologies and approaches

### Introduction to project management methodologies

Welcome back, as we've already discussed, not all projects are alike. Different types of projects will benefit from applying different project management approaches or methodologies. A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. Project management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall. We will talk through two different types, linear and iterative. Linear means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start. A linear approach would work well for a project like building a house. You'd need the blueprint created before you can begin laying the foundation. You've got to know exactly what the house will look like, its dimensions, and what type and how many resources you'll need. Then you've got to finish the foundation before you put up the walls and the walls before you put up the roof and so on before you have the finished project, which is a bungalow-style home. There's also a clear goal, you know exactly what the house will look like. It's unlikely that in the middle of building the house, your client is going to decide they'd rather have a multi-level Victorian instead of a single-level bungalow. What's more, even if they wanted to change, it's too late, you already laid the foundation and built the walls for the bungalow, done and done. A bungalow is what they wanted, and a bungalow is what they'll get. Using this type of linear project management approach, completing each step in order and sticking to the agreed upon specific results and being able to deliver just what the client ordered. For a project like producing a new show for a television company, on the other hand, it might be more effective to use a methodology that uses an iterative, more flexible approach where some of the phases in tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on. Your team comes up with an idea for a show and films a pilot. You ran several tests of the pilot in different locations and time slots. As your team gathers feedback about the pilot, adjustments to the show are made. At the same time, you're able to make decisions and start working on other parts of the project, like hiring permanent actors, starting film production, and working on advertising even while the final version of the show is being worked on. And even though the overall goal is clear, produce a new show, the type of show could end up being different from the original idea. Your team may have started out creating a one-hour show, but during testing they realized a half-hour show would actually be more popular. Or maybe a supporting character got a lot of positive feedback, so you want to make them one of the main characters. What's more important is that you produce a show that audiences are going to watch. Because of the iterative approach, plans remain flexible and you're able to make adjustments as you go along. Each of these projects, benefits from a different approach to how tasks will be carried out, in order to best meet the project's goals. Linear projects don't require many changes during development and have a clear sequential process. If you stick to the plan, it's likely you'll finish your tasks within the time schedule and all other criteria. Iterative projects allow for more flexibility and anticipate changes. You're able to test out parts of the project to make sure they work before the final result is delivered, and you can deliver parts of the project as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire project to be done. Over the years, the field of project management has developed many different methods that project managers can choose from that will help them manage most effectively. Google takes a hybrid approach to project management. We mix and match from different methods depending on the type of project. Our project managers are encouraged to adapt their own style to what makes the most sense to their project and their team. So are you starting to see how different approaches might benefit the projects you'll be working on now? Pretty soon you'll become a pro at picking an approach or combining approaches to fit with your project. Up next, we'll learn about the most well known and most used project management methods that you can add to your project management tool box.

### Overview of Waterfall and Agile

Two of the most popular project management methodologies are Waterfall and Agile. Each of these methods has a rich and complex history. In fact, you could take an entire certificate on just one of these methods alone. You'll have a chance to learn more about Waterfall and Agile methods in the upcoming courses of this certificate. Be sure to check those out after completing this one to learn more. For now, I'll just give you a brief introduction and provide you with some examples that illustrate how different types of projects can be more successful or easier to manage when you consider which method to use. First, let's take a look at the Waterfall approach. Waterfall as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases. You complete one at a time down the line like a waterfall starting at the top of a mountain and traveling to the bottom. Remember the definition and example of linear from that last video? Well, Waterfall has a linear approach. At first, Waterfall was used in the physical engineering disciplines like manufacturing and construction, then software emerged as an important field of engineering and Waterfall was applied to those projects as well. It still used a lot in engineering fields including product feature design and application, also known as app design. Over time, other industries like event planning and retail have adapted Waterfall phases to fit their projects. There are now many styles of Waterfall, and each style has its own specific set of steps. What they all have in common, though, is that they follow an ordered set of steps that are directly linked to clearly defined expectations, resources, and goals that are not likely to change. Let's take a closer look. The phases of a Waterfall project life cycle follow the same standard project life cycle flow that you learned about earlier. Initiating, planning, executing, which includes managing and completing tasks, and closing. When would you want to use a Waterfall approach to project management? Well, when the phases of the project are clearly defined or when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started. For example, if you are catering an event for a client on a very tight budget you might want to use Waterfall methodology. This way, you could confirm the number of guests first, then very clearly define the menu, get approval and agreement on the menu items and costs, order the unreturnable ingredients, and successfully feed the guests. Because the budget is limited, you can't afford to make changes or waste food. The traditional method won't allow for the client to make changes to the menu once the order has been placed. You can also reserve tables, chairs, and dishes because you know exactly how much and what kind of food is being prepared. A well-thought-out traditional approach to managing a project can help you reach your desired outcome with as little pain as possible during the project implementation. By spending extra effort thinking through the entire project upfront, you'll set yourself up for success. In an ideal world, following this approach will help you identify the right people and tasks, plan accordingly to avoid any hiccups along the way, create room for documenting your plans and progress, and enable you to hit that goal. However, plans don't always go according to plan. In fact, they rarely do. The Waterfall method has some risk management practices to help avoid and deal with project changes. Luckily, there are other methodologies that are entirely built for change and flexibility. One of these is Agile, another popular project management approach. The term agile means being able to move quickly and easily. It also refers to flexibility, which means being willing and able to change and adapt. Projects that use an Agile approach often have many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach. The concepts that shaped Agile methodology began to emerge in the 90s as a response to the growing demand for faster delivery of products, mainly software applications at that time. But it wasn't officially named Agile until 2001. The phases of an Agile project also follow the project life cycle stages we described earlier, generally speaking. However, rather than having to always go in order or wait for one phase to end before starting the next, Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints. Scrum is a form of Agile that you'll learn more about in the course focused entirely on Agile, and by sprint, we do not mean running a race as fast as possible. In this case, sprints are short chunks of time usually one to four weeks where a team works together to focus on completing specific tasks. What's important to understand is that Agile is more of a mindset than just a series of steps or phases. It's concerned with building an effective, collaborative team that seeks regular feedback from the client so that they can deliver the best value as quickly as possible and adjust as changes emerge. Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like. Another indicator that a project may benefit from Agile is the level of high uncertainty and risk involved with the project. We'll talk more about those things later. An example of a project that would work well with an Agile approach might be building a website. Your team would build the different parts of the website in sprints and deliver each part to the client as they are built. This way, the website can be launched with some parts, say the main homepage that are complete and ready for public view, while other parts, maybe the company blog or the ability to book online appointments, continue to get built out over time. This allows the team to get feedback early on about what works and what doesn't, make adjustments along the way, and reduce wasted efforts. This same website example, the Waterfall method will plan for and require the whole website to be complete before it can launch. Having a basic understanding of Waterfall and Agile will help you figure out an effective way to organize and plan out your project. Knowing about these two methodologies will come in handy during future job interviews, because you'll be able to demonstrate a solid understanding of the project management landscape. Waterfall and Agile are two of the more common and well-known project management methodologies, but they're by no means the only or the best ones. In the next videos, you'll learn about Lean Six Sigma, another way to approach projects. Here at Google, believe it or not, we select from many of these methodologies for project management.

### Comparing Waterfall and Agile approaches

Now that you know more about some of the different approaches and frameworks associated with project management, let's compare specific aspects of **Waterfall** (also commonly called **traditional**) and **Agile** approaches.

![cryIdaRYS068iHWkWLtO6A_40a927e47ed44ad0a98fff962f76bcf1_C1M3L3R1](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cryIdaRYS068iHWkWLtO6A_40a927e47ed44ad0a98fff962f76bcf1_C1M3L3R1.png?expiry=1659916800000&hmac=zgNuiNopuMeRx5lY8G9l79NH-YT8a8yeThegOo5Sjeg)

Understanding the fundamentals of—and differences between—these common project management approaches can help you demonstrate your project management knowledge during an interview. It can also help you evaluate a project to determine the right approach when working on the job.

Waterfall and Agile are implemented in many different ways on many different projects, and some projects may use aspects of each. The chart below briefly describes and compares Waterfall and Agile approaches. You can use it as a quick reference tool, but be aware that in practice, the differences between these two approaches may not always be clearly defined.

Now that you better understand the differences between Waterfall and Agile project management approaches, you can use this understanding to determine which is most effective for your projects.

### Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma

Now, you've got Waterfall and Agile methodologies in your project manager toolbox, Lean Six Sigma is one more you can add. It's a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma. The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment. The idea is that when your team feels valued, motivation and productivity increases and the whole process functions more smoothly. There are five phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach. They are define, measure, analyze, improve, and control, commonly known as DMAIC. DMAIC is a strategy for process improvement, meaning you're trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and fix them so that everything runs more smoothly. The goal of each step is to ensure the best possible results for your project. Just like with Waterfall and Agile, there're more specific details for using DMAIC and the Lean Six Sigma approach. But what's great about the DMAIC process is that it can be used to solve any business problem. Let's break it down. The first phase is to define the project goal and what it will take to meet it. This first phase is very similar to the initiation phase of traditional project management. Let's take a real scenario to illustrate. Imagine that you are brought on as a project manager for a large travel company to help streamline and minimize customer service wait times that have been surging due to a recent sales promotion. Before you begin working on tackling the issue, you're going to need to define the project goal and talk to stakeholders about expectations for the project. In this case, the goal is to take average wait times down to less than 10 minutes on average compared to 30 minutes. Next, it's time to measure how the current process is performing. In order to improve processes, DMAIC focuses on data. Here you want to map out the current process and locate exactly where the problems are and what kind of effect the problems have on the process. Using our example, you're trying to figure out why it's taking so long for the travel company to address a customer service issue. To do this, you look at company data like average wait times, number of customers per day, and seasonal variations. Then you'll set a plan for how you'll get that data and how often to measure it. This could look something like having the company generate reports on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. In other situations, you might have employees or customers fill out surveys or look at inventory, shipping, and tracking records, things like that. Once you have the data and measurements, you can move on to the next phase which is analyze. Here, you'll begin to identify gaps and issues. In our example, after mapping out the process and data points, you may see that staffing is inadequate on days where customers are the highest. Data analysis is important for project managers regardless of which method you choose and we will learn more about that in an upcoming course. From your data, you'll have a strong understanding of causes and solutions to get to the next stage, improve. Oftentimes, project managers may want to leap straight to this phase but really projects in process improvements should only be made after a careful analysis. This is the point where you present your findings and get ready to start making improvements. In our example, this could be modifying staffing to address customer needs. The last step of this cycle is control. You've gotten the process and project to a good place, and now it's time to implement it and keep it there. Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place and continue to monitor so the company doesn't revert back to the old, inefficient way of doing things. To sum it all up, you can remember DMAIC like this, defining tells you what to measure, measuring tells you what to analyze, analyzing tells you what to improve, and improving tells you what to control. Lean Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach are ideal when the project goal includes improving the current process to fix complex or high risk problems like improving sales, conversions, or eliminating a bottleneck, which is when things get backed up during a process. Following the DMAIC process prevents the likelihood of skipping important steps and increases the chances of a successful project. As a way for your team to discover best practices that your client can use going forward, it uses data and focuses on the customer or end-user to solve problems in a way that builds on previous learning so that you can discover effective permanent solutions for difficult problems. There are many ways out there that break the flow of project management into digestible phases and approaches, all with the same end goal of accomplishing the desired outcome as smoothly as possible and delivering the best value. Like I said earlier, at Google we follow a lot of different approaches. For instance, an engineering team releasing a customer-focused product may primarily use Agile when creating the product, but decide to plug in some of the aspects of Waterfall project management for planning and documentation. A customer service team might focus on using Lean Six Sigma to improve an experience for our users like offering new features based on a recent analysis. But the team might develop parts of the code and roll out the features using Agile iterations and sprints to allow for change. Or one of our internal education and training teams may focus solely on Waterfall project management to achieve a targeted goal of having all employees complete an annual compliance training. Here, Waterfall makes sense since the requirements of the training program are fixed and so is the deadline and goal. The biggest takeaway is to know the various methods and tools to be able to confidently apply what works best for you, your team, and the end goal. There is no real prescription for how to execute a project perfectly because there're always pieces you can't 100 percent control. But the good news is, you can get pretty close with the skill sets you develop through learning about these different frameworks.

### Lean and Six Sigma methodologies

Previously you learned about Agile and Waterfall project management approaches. Now, we will define some key concepts from Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. We will learn how these methodologies can be used to organize and manage your projects, and we will discuss which is the most effective for different kinds of projects.

**Lean**

**Lean** methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.

Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as:

- Lack of proper documentation

- Lack of process standards

- Not understanding the customers’ needs

- Lack of effective communication

- Lack of process control

- Inefficient process design

- Failures of management

These same issues create waste in project management.

Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits.

You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps:

1. **Sort:** Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials.

2. **Set in order:** Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away.

3. **Shine:** Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.

4. **Standardize:** Perform the process in the same way every time.

5. **Sustain:** Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance.

The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The **Kanban** scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when. The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work.

![HZeGV9lOQvyXhlfZTsL8Kg_11c89e04d32944cb980fc6004294190e_Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-7.39.12-PM](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/HZeGV9lOQvyXhlfZTsL8Kg_11c89e04d32944cb980fc6004294190e_Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-7.39.12-PM.png?expiry=1659916800000&hmac=_fJUuYUBULtuXfEV0kwD6pE33iJZCROZ3lKIPICjmFo)

Kanban boards and 5S are core methods of the Lean methodology. They can help you successfully manage your project. Now let’s analyze the Six Sigma method and learn when is the best time to use it.

**Six Sigma**

**Six Sigma** is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

1. Always focus on the customer.

2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.

3. Make your processes flow smoothly.

4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.

5. Stop defects by removing variation.

6. Involve and collaborate with your team.

7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.

Now that you understand both Lean and Six Sigma, let's see how they come together to improve the performance of your project!

**Lean Six Sigma**

After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected.

The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects.

### Common project management approaches and how to select one

You have been learning a lot about different project management approaches and when to use them. In this reading, we will briefly recap some of the most common ones and recommend a couple of articles with supporting information. You’ll continue to learn more about these approaches throughout this certificate program.

**Popular project management approaches**

Below is a brief recap of some of the project management approaches you’ve been introduced to so far:

**Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

**Kanban** is a tool used in both Agile and Lean approaches that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

**Lean** uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.

**Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

**Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S organization framework, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach.

Despite their differences, all of these project management methodologies require communication and collaboration among various teams and aim to deliver projects on time and within budget.

**Selecting a project management approach**

With so many methodologies available, there are many options that would work well for your project. Since projects and the organizations in which you will execute them vary greatly, the approach you choose to implement for each project will vary. At Google, we often use a hybrid of approaches and frameworks to efficiently meet the project goal! All approaches can be combined with others, depending on the needs of your project.

Choosing an approach that works best for the project, the organization, and the team takes time and practice. You’ll learn more about how to choose a project management approach throughout this certificate program. In the meantime, take a look at how this article breaks down common methodologies and when (or when not) to use them:

### Wrap-up

Congrats on completing this module on the project life cycle and project management methodologies. So what did you think? Hopefully, this introduction to a few of the core project management methodologies and hearing from a Googler about the way we approach project management here at Google has you interested and excited to keep on learning. One of the great things about project management is that it can be really creative and present you with challenging problems to solve that have a rewarding impact. You get to work with teams full of interesting, skilled, and dedicated people who help with the problem-solving and idea-generating process. Every project is an opportunity to learn and try something new. Waterfall, Agile, and Lean Six Sigma are solid foundations from which to build your understanding of project management. Each methodology has its own set of rules, values, and processes. There is no such thing as a right or a wrong methodology. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to take, and there is almost no limit to the number of ways you can blend different approaches to fit the needs of your project. Your goal in choosing a methodology is to maximize the use of resources and time. The method, or combination of methods, will help you reach your goal in the most efficient and effective way. This might feel like choice overload right here, but hang in there. With time and practice, you will become more comfortable with the benefits and limits of different methodologies, and you'll be able to approach your project assignments with confidence. Next, you'll build on these foundations by learning how an organization structure and culture can impact the way you manage your project.

## WEEK 4

## Understanding Organizational structure

### Introduction: Organizational structure and culture

Hey there, how are you feeling so far? We're nearing the end of this course. And honestly, you've done a great job. Previously, we talked about the life cycle of a project, the task breakdown of phases, and some different methodologies you can use as a project manager to help ensure your project success. You also heard from my colleagues about some of the ways we manage projects at Google. Here, you'll learn about organizational structure and culture and how they impact the way you set up and execute your project. I'll describe some common types of structures that you're likely to encounter during your project management career. You'll also learn about change management, which refers to the way you present the final project to the organization and get them to accept and implement your project outcome. These are important elements to ensure that your project is adopted and lives on. Are you ready? Let's get into these concepts.

### Overview of Classic and Matrix structures

Welcome back. In this video, I'm going to talk about the concept of organizational structure and the project manager's role within a given structure. Keep in mind that your role won't be the same for every team or organization, because many companies are structured differently. But this overview will serve as a foundation for wherever you work. So what is organizational structure? Organizational structure refers to the way a company or organization is arranged or structured. This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another. In other words, organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who. But organizational structure is much more than that. Understanding the different types of organizational structures can serve as a map to help you determine where you fit in, who you should communicate with, and how frequently to communicate with them. Now that we have a basic overview of the definition of organizational structure, let's look at the various organizational hierarchies that you may encounter at work. An organization's structure is most commonly mapped out using a reporting chart or "org chart," which is short for "organizational chart." Reporting charts show the relationship between people and groups within the organization, and details who each person or group reports to. There are a few different types of organizational structures. But for this course, we're going to focus on two of the more popular ones: Classic and Matrix. Let's start with Classic. The Classic grouping includes what are usually called "functional" or "top-down" structures. The Classic grouping follows a typical chain of command where the Chief Executive Officer, also known as CEO, and other executives are at the top, followed by directors or managers, then their direct reports and so on. Each of these directors or managers typically oversee teams within their function of the organization, like marketing, sales, or human resources. You can see this type of structure in effect by looking at a branch of the military. Take the Army, for example. You may enter the Army as a private, and report up to a sergeant who oversees multiple people in your squad, and that sergeant ultimately reports up to a lieutenant and so on. If your organization works in this structure, as the project manager, you might communicate regularly with your manager, the person directly above you, and also with your peers who work on the same types of projects as you. There isn't always a straightforward, top-down approach. There are other factors at play that make organizational structures a bit more complicated than we can see on paper. For instance, you may have project teams that sit across different functions. This is common in many companies, Google included, and is usually referred to as the Matrix structure. You might think of a Matrix structure as a grid where you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments who expect to hear updates on your work progress. These people may not be your direct bosses, but you are responsible for communicating with them, since they may inform changes to your work. For example, at Google, we have the major functions of marketing, sales, and more, with the traditional reporting chain. But we also have programs for our products, like Google Search, where project teams consist of program managers, engineers, user experience or "UX" designers, and so on, and each team member reports to their own management chains. Another example is my organization. It's called Global Affairs. I have a direct manager who oversees the work I do and my core role and who is responsible for delivering my performance reviews. But because I work with multiple people across other teams and specialties, I often get asked to manage projects where I'm informally working with lead program managers in other organizations. Similar to my own manager, I provide updates to that program manager, seek their approval, and solicit feedback on our partnership and progress. So to recap, the Classic structure follows a traditional, top-down system of reporting, and the Matrix structure has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs. Knowing which kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and carry out your project or even in an interview. During an interview, you can ask about the type of organizational structure the company uses and where your role will fit in. This will help you and the interviewer communicate clearly about the people you will engage with daily, and the expectations for the role. In the next course, you'll hear from a Googler about a third type of structure, Project Management Office, which you might see in some of the organizations where you work or interview.

### A project manager's role within different organizational structures

In the last video, you learned about the way a company is arranged, which is called **organizational structure.** You also learned that two of the most common organizational structures are **Classic and Matrix**.

Understanding the differences in Classic and Matrix organizational structures can help you ask questions during a job interview to fully understand the role and responsibilities you are considering. This will also help you understand which skills will be most important for you to have if you get the position.

Once you are hired into a role, knowing a company’s organizational structure can help you identify key points of communication and key stakeholders. It can also help you navigate within the organization when you need support or need to determine who has authority in a certain situation. Let’s examine the characteristics of each of these organizational structures in greater depth so you can identify the type of structure an organization has and how to navigate it as a project manager.

**Classic organizational structures**

The **Classic organizational structure** is a top-down hierarchy system, where a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has direct authority over several department managers. The department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees. This system requires communication both up and down the ladder. In a Classic structure, authority comes from the top and filters to the bottom. Frequent reporting of project status updates may be required to pass up through management levels to keep higher leaders informed.

Classic organizations are also referred to as **functional organizations** because the organization is divided into departments based on function. Each department is led by a **functional manager**, and employees are grouped according to the functions of their role. For example, the main function of Friendly Skies Airlines, an airline company, is to fly airplanes. There are typically departments logically arranged to fulfill other important company functions, such as Marketing, Human Resources, and Strategy. Employees usually have a specialty within the organization and may not work within other areas during normal everyday operations.

**Managing a project in a Classic organization**

Friendly Skies Airlines has a Classic organizational structure, as indicated by its reporting or “org” chart.

![-mxT0pKDRBqsU9KSgwQaow_7b9559eba0a84b4ba9eb145bc3fa8df1_Classic-structure](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-mxT0pKDRBqsU9KSgwQaow_7b9559eba0a84b4ba9eb145bc3fa8df1_Classic-structure.jpg?expiry=1659916800000&hmac=tuoFD-gv1qJcbGeL4DfyJX19VqyIcF2C0vYHDrjYltk)

Imagine that the Friendly Skies Airlines Board of Directors approves an initiative to retrofit existing airplanes to carry more passengers. The CEO sponsors a project team to redesign the airplanes. The project will be led by a project manager from the Engineering and Innovation department and will require representatives from Finance, Marketing, Strategy, and Operations, along with several other team members from the Design department, to successfully complete the project.

The project team will typically remain in their reporting lines but act as their own assembled team. They do not fall under any of the existing functional departments. In the Classic organizational structure, the project builds from already existing departments to form teams.

If you are a project manager in this type of structure, you may need to consult with functional managers to understand your resources and the capacity of each teammate, as well as to familiarize yourself with each function’s internal processes and approval structure. Your authority may be slightly limited due to competing priorities, approval chains, and other complexities, but setting expectations up front will enable you to navigate the organization and execute your project successfully.

**Matrix organizational structures**

The **Matrix** structure differs from the Classic structure in that the employees have two or more managers. In Matrix structures, you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments with whom you will need to communicate on your work progress. Functional areas tend to cross paths more frequently, and depending on the nature of the work, the responsible manager for each area has the most authority.

As a project manager in a Matrix organization, a team will essentially have at least two chains of command, or managers. You can think of the project manager as being a temporary manager while assigned to the team. The functional manager is consistent regardless of the project a project manager is supporting. The visual below illustrates what the Friendly Skies Airlines would look like if it had a Matrix organizational structure.

Imagine that Friendly Skies Airlines is organized in a Matrix structure. Their Product Excellence team develops a new amenity kit for long-haul flights. They ask the Project Manager to help gather marketing materials that present research data about how this product fulfills passenger desires. The Project Manager is working on behalf of the Product Excellence team, but they are able to work in partnership with the Marketing team to create these materials.

You can read more about an overview of Matrix organizations in this [PMI article.](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/matrix-organization-structure-reason-evolution-1837)

**Key takeaway**

In both Classic and Matrix organizations, project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively. However, within most Matrix organizations, some project managers or department leads may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.

Now you know how to identify Classic and Matrix organizational structures, how project managers fit into them, and how an organization’s structure may affect projects. You are well on your way to becoming a great project manager in any organizational structure!

### How organizational structure impacts project management

Hey again, ready to keep going? The previous videos explained that knowing what kind of organizational structure you're working in plays a major role in how you prepare for and carry out your project. An organization's structure provides the framework for accountability and communication. As the project manager, it's vital that you understand who you're reporting to on each project, and just as importantly, who the members of your team report to. Knowing the organizational structure also tells you how and where to get the resources you'll need so you can get the project done efficiently. When you understand the organization's structure, you'll be able to identify how it impacts the way you manage the project. One way organizational structure can impact the way you manage a project is by the amount of authority given to the project manager. Authority has to do with your ability to make decisions for the project that impact the organization. In some cases, you might have the authority to do things like select the vendors who provide services or goods for the project. Other times, you might have a set of vendors selected for you. Your level of authority and responsibility will vary from project to project. Another way organizational structures can impact project management is through resource availability. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need. Let's explore how different structures can affect the way you manage a project. In a Classic structure, you might find yourself with less authority and a tighter scope. You may need to rely on getting approval from the appropriate managers, directors, and department heads in order to move forward and complete certain tasks. In this case, it's likely that these people are in charge of the people on your team and the resources you need. As a project manager working in a Classic structure, you may depend on the managers in your organization to approve resources. In other words, the amount of people working on your project or the budget that you have allocated to your project is decided by the leaders of your department or function. In a Classic structure, you may have to go through a chain of approvals and advocate for more resources if you need them. For example, if you need a budget increase, you would report this to your manager. Then your manager might escalate this up to their management chain to get approval. That's the Classic structure; a traditional top-down arrangement of employees and authority. Now, let's explore the Matrix structure. The main difference with a Matrix structure is that employees often have two or more managers or leaders they'll need to work with and update. Your team members will have their functional manager and you, the project manager. If members are working on multiple projects, they may have even more managers. This can affect your authority as a project manager, as you will need to cooperate with more than one leader in the organization. You may need to share resources and negotiate priorities. The key is to make sure you know who your stakeholders are and who controls what since the chain of command isn't always as clearly defined as in the Classic structure. Because there isn't always a clear chain of command in a Matrix structure, you need to make sure you have identified and communicated with anyone you might need to report to and get approval from well before the project begins. Once this is established though, your project within a Matrix structure should be able to run efficiently. Matrix structures emphasize a strong project focus from the team and the organization. You as the project manager, generally have more autonomy to make decisions and gather resources as needed. As I hope you've noticed, the way an organization is structured can have a big impact on the planning and execution of your project. Understanding all of this will help you run and manage a project much more efficiently. Next, I'll tell you about organizational culture, another factor that impacts how you manage your project. Catch you in a bit.

### The role of a Project Management Office

In this lesson, you are learning about different types of organizational structures. Project managers serve key functions in both Classic and Matrix organizations. Within both of these types of structures, there is sometimes a group devoted specifically to program management with the organization: the **Project Management Office**. In this reading, we will discuss the purpose and functions of a Project Management Office.

**What is a PMO?**

A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization. It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization’s projects, helping them run more smoothly and efficiently.

An organization’s project managers may operate within the PMO itself or within other departments. At Google, for example, there are project managers who work in a PMO focused on operational excellence, but there are numerous project and program managers in other departments throughout the organization, as well.

**What are the functions of a PMO?**

PMOs offer guidance and support to their organization’s project managers. They share best practices, project statuses, and direction for all of the organization’s projects while often taking on strategic projects themselves. The main functions of a PMO include:

**Strategic planning and governance**

This is the most important function of a PMO. This involves defining project criteria, selecting projects according to the organization’s business goals, and then providing a business case for those projects to management.

**Best practices**

PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization. They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects. They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.

**Common project culture**

PMOs help set common project culture practices by training employees about optimal approaches and best practices. This helps keep project management practices consistent and efficient across the entire organization.

**Resource management**

PMOs are often responsible for managing and allocating resources—such as people and equipment—across projects throughout the organization based on budget, priorities, schedules, and more. They also help define the roles and responsibilities needed on any given project. PMOs provide training, mentoring, and coaching to all employees, but project managers in particular.

**Creation of project documentation, archives, and tools**

PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects. They also play an important role in maintaining their organization’s project history. Once a project closes, they archive all of the documents created during the project for future reference and to capture lessons learned.

**Key takeaway**

To recap, the key purposes of a PMO include: strategic planning and governance, implementing project management best practices, establishing common project culture, resource management, and creating project documentation, archives, and tools. PMOs support their organizations in managing large numbers of projects and help keep all employees working in the same direction towards the organization’s goals.

### Lan: Working in a Project Management Office

Hi, I'm Lan. I'm a Director of Program Management at Google. A program management director has a team of project managers to help execute and bring products to our users. I work on the project management team or the PMO team for a group called "Geo." And in Geo we bring geo-spatial products to our users. Things like Google Maps and Google Earth. And the team that I'm a part of actually works on all of the data and imagery that powers all of those products. A Project Management Office is a team of project managers. We are a group that coordinates all of the different parts of a project together, including folks who work on our product, engineers, and many business functions, and we help bring all of those ideas to life. My role specifically in working in a PMO is ensuring that we're connecting all of the different parts that are associated with projects to ensure that they are all connected together. Sometimes we find out when projects are happening, there's a piece of it here and a piece of it there, and they may not even know about each other. One of the most critical things that Project Managers get to do is they get to have a bird's eye view of everything that's happening in a project. So that's a lot of my role, and what I'm working on with my team is ensuring that all of the pieces that need to connect together actually do connect together. I've had many different roles inside of many different PMOs inside my career. All the way from taking just a piece of a part of a project when I was really early in my career, and then expanded that into taking a full end-to-end project which were smaller. And then building up my career and then moving it to really large, complex projects. And at each stage of these I have loved every piece of it. So even from the time that I had only a part of a project, I got to go really deep inside of some of those technologies and have really deep and meaningful relationships with the teams that I have been working with. And that's not always possible when you're working on a really large project that has hundreds of people. You won't be able to develop deep relationships across that large group. On the flip side, when you're working on a large, complex project, you get to see all of the different gears turning inside of a large ecosystem of things that are happening. But that took a long time in my career to build up, but at each phase of it, I realized I was learning a little bit more. And I was learning how to work a little bit more broadly and think a little bit more differently. But really ensuring how do you continue to keep the execution and rigor of a project to ensure that ideas were coming to life. One of the biggest benefits I see in working in a PMO is that you get to share a lot of best practices with each other. One of the downsides, I think for project management, is typically we don't get to work with each other because we're working with a lot of client teams and we're working with other disciplines. But a huge benefit of working in a PMO is that you get to connect with other project managers, where you can share your challenges and see how somebody else had gotten through it. Or you can share templates or tools that you may take time to develop on your own, but somebody else already has handy, so you can borrow or just steal their tool for your own use. But the best part is you have a community of people who think the same way about problems in a very methodical, in a very task-oriented, in a very action-oriented and goal-oriented way, which is not typically true if you're working across all other disciplines all the time.

## Understanding the impact of organizational culture

### Introduction to organizational culture

Hey again, let's begin with two quick questions. What do you know about culture, and how do you define culture? When I hear the term culture, the first things that come to mind are things like languages, food, clothing, and types of dress. It's important to note that there are other, maybe less obvious, but just as impactful parts of culture like beliefs, traditions, and customs. When we learn about someone's culture, we gain a much deeper insight and more complete picture into who they are and how they navigate the world. The same can be true for organizations. An organization's culture provides context and acts as a guide for what their people value, how they operate on a daily basis, how they relate to one another, and how they can be expected to perform. There are many ways to define organizational culture. Some definitions emphasize teamwork and innovation, while others focus on attention to detail and achievement. Entire thesis papers, workshops, and conferences are dedicated to defining and analyzing organizational culture. We only have a few minutes here, so I'll do my best to sum it up. Organizational culture is in part the values employees share, as well as the organization's values, mission, history, and so on. In other words, organizational culture can be thought of as the company's personality. Understanding an organization's culture will help you navigate your team more effectively toward achieving the project's goal. It also impacts the way you plan your project. You'll need to be familiar with an organization's culture, so that you can minimize conflict and complete the project with as much support and harmony as possible. An organization's mission and values can provide clues to its culture. If you can demonstrate how the project supports the company's mission or how the project aligns with the company's values, you'll have more support from executives and stakeholders to get the approvals and resources you need. Pay attention to what leaders in the organization value when conducting business. Does the management team care about speed over perfection? How do people within the organization make decisions? Do they thoroughly examine every option for every decision? This will help inform which values are the most important to them and how you can approach your decision-making. If you're ever stuck in your project and need guidance about making a certain decision, or are unsure how to communicate with someone in the organization, reviewing the mission and values may help direct you toward the right way to handle that situation. Here's an example.: if the company values stability and user feedback, it might encourage expanding the project timeline to allow for testing and then making decisions based on those testing results. If the company values innovation and revenue growth, it might encourage a shorter timeline to get the product out faster, and taking some risks to try out new ideas. As a project manager, when you understand the different types of values, and what to prioritize, you'll have an idea of how you can better prepare for conversations within the organization. Ideally, you'll want to have a good sense of an organization's culture before you start the first phase of your project. If you are interviewing for a project management position, asking about the culture is a great way to get more information about the company. It also shows the interviewer that you're knowledgeable about the impact culture can have on a project. To help you gain a better sense of an organization's culture, consider the following questions. How do people prefer to communicate? Is it primarily through scheduled meetings, via email, over the phone? How are decisions made, majority vote or top down approvals? What kinds of rituals are in place when someone new comes to the office? Are they taken out to lunch, given a tour of the building or introduced to the staff? How are projects typically run? Do they prefer a Classic, do they prefer Matrix, or some other style of project management? And finally, what kinds of practices, behaviors, and values are reflected by the people in the organization? Is overtime or weekend work an expectation? Are there company sanctioned social events? Finding out what the company values, will tell you a lot about the culture. And how to handle communication, manage expectations, and identify potential conflicts as you work through your project. Once you begin working on a project, here are some ways to navigate company culture that will help you get the most out of your team, and ensure that your project is supported. As I just discussed, make sure to ask questions. As you observe the culture, try asking your peers what they think is going well and what they would change. Your peers may have the same opinion as you, and if not you may learn something new you didn't learn in the interview process. Either way, you'll be in a better place to assess risk, adjust your current project, or be more prepared for projects in the future. It's also a good idea to make observations. It's important to understand how things work, and what people like and respect about the company's culture. When working in different geographies, it's also important to be aware of established customs, like bowing, shaking hands, or wearing head coverings. This will help you gain understanding and form respectful relationships. Lastly, it's important to understand your impact. Be aware of your role as a change agent. A change agent is someone who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. You and your project will most likely affect the organization in some way. Sometimes just the presence of a project manager creates changes in the office environment or employee dynamics. If your project requires major changes that the organization must adapt to, be mindful of how extreme those changes could be and seek feedback and approval early on. The company may not agree with certain kinds of changes that don't seem to fall in line with their mission, vision, or culture. It's important to recognize the limits or boundaries of changes to implement and understand what would be the most beneficial for the project and the company overall. As you can see, organizational culture has a strong influence over how decisions are made about the project. The way an organization is structured usually influences the type of culture that exists. So it's important to consider both structure and culture when planning and carrying out your project. Coming up, we'll talk about the way your project can create change in the workplace and how to get stakeholders and employees on board with implementing your project.

### Learning about an organization’s culture

It is important to learn about the culture of the organization where you work or want to work. Understanding the company’s culture can help you navigate your team through a project. Consider this quote from Peter Drucker, an expert on management: ”Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” Drucker is implying that the culture of a company always influences its success, regardless of how effective the company’s business model may be. Organizational culture is critical to the health of a company, the people who work there, and the customers it serves.

**The importance of organizational culture**

- **Identity:** An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave.

- **People:** Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.

- **Processes:** Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture.

**Understanding an organization’s culture**

As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on. Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values. To learn more about a company’s culture and how it applies to you as a project manager, you can:

**Ask questions**

You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. You might want to ask questions about:

**Atmosphere**

- What is the company’s dress code?

- How do people typically share credit at this company?

- Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?

- How do managers support and motivate their team?

- How do people in this role interact with customers and users?

- When and how do team members give feedback to one another?

- What are some workplace traditions?

- What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?

**Policies**

- What are the policies around sick days and vacation?

- Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?

- What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?

**Processes**

- What is the company’s onboarding process?

- How do employees measure the impact of their work?

**Values**

- What are the company’s mission and value statements?

- How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?

- How does the organization support professional development and career growth?

**Listen to people’s stories**

Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.

- What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past?

- What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers?

**Take note of company rituals**

Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience.

- How are birthdays and holidays celebrated?

- Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place?

- Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm.

- Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature?

- Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles?

**Understand your impact**

As a project manager, you become a change agent. Remember: a **change agent** is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.

**Sharpen your communication skills**

Interpersonal communication skills are a major part of project management. How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture. You will most likely have interactions with various departments and management levels while executing projects. To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company. Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually? Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? This can help you make sure you are adhering to expectations.

Approaching projects differently from how similar projects were managed in the past may be met with some resistance. Although some projects may call for you to break the status quo, when you show an appreciation of your organization’s culture, you may help your team members accept any improvements you are implementing.

**Key takeaway**

Organizational culture is important because it has a direct impact on you as a project manager, and learning how to navigate organizational culture gives you a great advantage when you are executing projects. Being able to navigate departmental interactions, communicate effectively, and plan your project in line with the organization’s culture will help set you up for success in your project management career path.

### Amar: Project management in life and in the organization

Hi, I'm Amar. I'm a Senior Engineering Program Manager at Google Shopping. On a day-to-day basis, I drive programs which spans across multiple products at Google. The way I look at program management, it's more like, life is program management. Everything in life is program; having kids, building a house, buying car. Everything we do there's a start and end deal. What we see across the board in anything and everything we do, there's a tremendous amount of friction in the system. In the decision-making, in the budgeting, everything in life. That applies equally to software program management, or even if you are in the construction industry. If you see right from starting the construction project, to really getting the bids and all the stuff. There's a tremendous amount of chaos from the perspective of that you know, are the right people connected? Are the right decision-making people in the meeting? Are there the right number of approvals that we have in a timely basis? There are many of these things that I had witnessed during my career and the previous companies and even at Google, that those were not efficient and those were really adding a huge risk or exposing the risk late in the development cycle. That is what I had seen as a chaotic world. I really felt that you know what? I can really help out in solving some of that chaos. On a day-to-day basis, I work on bringing order into chaos. There's chaotic world out there in the software program development, so we as a program manager, make sure that we bring that together. When I started my program management journey, one of the main thing, what I was looking for, (and thanks to the mentors, I really cherish the mentors) one of the thing they taught me, that you know what? "Amar, when you're coming to work every day, ask what are the top three challenges that you want to solve today?" To date, I follow... I always follow... think about what are the top three things that I want to address today? Big ones, impactful ones, as well as I also look at and also help my team understand on a weekly basis, how success looks like. Every Monday morning, I'll have meeting with the strategy folks. Very strategic discussions on how the success looks like in this week. How would we define the week is successful? That is how I start my week. It works miracles in the program delivery and overall in life. I love those aspects.

### Case study: Balancing company culture and strategic goals

As you’ve learned, **organizational culture** refers to the values employees share and an organization’s values, mission, history, and more. In other words, organizational culture can be thought of as a company's personality. A company’s organizational culture can help drive its internal and external success. When a company’s culture is aligned with its corporate strategy and goals, the level at which it can perform is impressive. When researching a company for a possible new job, understanding the company’s culture can help you decide if it is a good fit for you and your priorities. Also, understanding a company's culture as a project manager can help you make informed choices about when you want your actions and decisions to fit within the culture or when you might choose to intentionally push back against the culture to effect change or create improvements. Let’s explore an example of a positive organizational culture and how a project manager fits into that culture.

**The Family Java culture**

The Family Java coffeehouse has over 2,000 stores worldwide. The Family Java’s culture is closely linked to their strategy and capabilities—this is what they feel sets them apart from other coffee shops. The company has invested in a relationship-driven, employees-first approach. Their culture establishes that the employees are what makes the company unique. This helps foster a warm, comfortable, and calm environment for both employees and customers alike. Because The Family Java’s organizational culture has cultivated employees who genuinely care about the company and their jobs, those employees create the same environment for their customers to enjoy.

![NuT4Y424Ruqk-GONuMbq_Q_a5f9c3c708df4bceb3af8a67ac65f350_C1M4L2R2-1-](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NuT4Y424Ruqk-GONuMbq_Q_a5f9c3c708df4bceb3af8a67ac65f350_C1M4L2R2-1-.png?expiry=1659916800000&hmac=i3EWa5XvONQxw9Ferr48HNxk1jS_qgwdvYIf-gs5We0)

The Family Java’s mission and values speak to this approach directly:

**Mission**

- To provide a welcoming environment where our employees become our family and our guests become our friends.

**Values**

- To create a place where everyone is welcome

- To always give our best and hold ourselves accountable for the results

- To treat others with respect and kindness

The Family Java has worked hard to be able to create the structure to put their mission and values into practice daily. They practice these values, all while achieving new levels in sales and growth. For example, The Family Java believes in expressing their employees-first value by spending more on employee healthcare than on coffee beans! Each employee is crucial to the success of the company and their ability to fulfill their mission and adhere to their values. In turn, the company makes their employees feel valued by offering substantial training, education scholarships, assistance with daycare, and growth within the company.

The Family Java is able to capitalize on the critical link between culture and strategic goals to achieve optimal performance. When evaluating their organizational culture, the company focuses on their positive attributes and adapts to what works and has proven to be beneficial. By taking the time to perfect what the company does well, The Family Java has created a culture that drives out negativity, empowers employees to be their best selves, and aligns with their strategic goals.

**A project manager’s relationship to organizational culture**

**Learning the company’s values**

Avi was excited to begin his role as a project manager at The Family Java. He had asked questions about the organization’s culture during his job interview and was told about the company’s people-first approach. Avi’s previous company prioritized profitability over teamwork and mentorship. While his previous company was very successful, it was difficult for Avi to engage meaningfully in his work because the culture was so focused on financial results rather than on their employees’ job satisfaction. Avi felt like The Family Java’s approach better aligned with his own values.

**Clarifying the company’s expectations**

Avi’s manager at The Family Java said that his role would involve a substantial emphasis on team building and keeping morale high. When he began, Avi asked his manager to clarify the time investment expected by the company in order to accomplish team- and morale-building goals. He also asked for suggestions and guidance based on what had been done at the company in the past. If Avi had made incorrect assumptions about the company’s culture and tried to manage projects with his previous company’s culture in mind, he might have emphasized speed over collaboration and communication. Avi now knew that he would need to carefully balance expectations related to The Family Java’s culture with the project workload in order to meet project timelines and achieve the desired outcome.

**Applying organizational culture to a project**

Before beginning his first project, Avi planned a team lunch to get to know everyone at The Family Java. Then, he scheduled one-on-one meetings with each of his team members to learn more about their working style and professional goals. He also asked how he could help support and remove any barriers for them. One of Avi’s team members, Miguel, said that he needed to start his workday early because he picked his children up from school at 3:00. After hearing this, Avi avoided scheduling team meetings in the late afternoon. Another team member, Elisa, told Avi that she preferred face-to-face or phone conversations to email since she felt like she communicated better verbally. When Avi needed to discuss something with Elisa, he made sure that he talked with her in person as much as possible. Avi continued to check in with all of his team members regularly as the project progressed. He also scheduled weekly “Coffee Chats” with his team, since he had learned that this was company tradition. Avi’s efforts to align his project management style to The Family Java’s organizational culture were noticed by executives and stakeholders, and he was given a lot of support in getting the resources he needed.

**Key takeaway**

The culture of each organization you encounter will be different and can change over time. Like Avi, it is worth your time as a project manager to learn about your company's culture because it directly relates to your projects’ success.

## Understanding change management

### Introduction to change management

Welcome back. Let's talk about change management. Sometimes the deliverable of a project is a new tool or new process that must be adopted by the organization. You've just learned that understanding organizational structure and culture will help you plan for and manage your project. It will also help you roll out changes from your project to an organization. In project management, the process of delivering your completed project and getting people to adopt it is called change management. Understanding change management can ensure that a project is completed successfully and that the organization accepts and adopts the recommendations from the project. For example, if you are launching a new time tracking system for employees, the project wouldn't be successful if the employees didn't adopt the new system. When you understand change management and your role in the process, it can ensure a smooth roll out of changes and easier adoption. Adoption is often the first step to your project having the desired impact once it goes live. Let's get started. As a new project manager, you may not be responsible for planning all of the required change management for your project. But regardless, you can help the success of the project by understanding your role in the process and how your organization may react to that change. It's important to recognize that it's the people in an organization who are directly impacted by any changes in the workplace. Implementing a new project can mean changes to processes, budgets, schedules, and employee roles and responsibilities. Even aesthetic changes, like building a new wing, renovating the lobby, or switching to a new company logo, means employees will have to adjust to something new and different. Something as simple as adding a new logo can lead to a major headache for the employees, who have to swap out all the old stationery and make sure everyone in the office is using the new logo correctly. When you consider the success of your project, it's important to keep in mind the changes that people will need to implement as a result. Thinking through these changes will set you up for success in getting your project accepted and adopted. There are many change management models and strategies and a quick internet search will provide you with more explanations and examples than you will probably ever need. While we have additional readings on change management coming up, feel free to read on any articles on the topic from well respected project management organizations to keep learning. Though there are lots of different models, they all share the same general concepts. Change management in project management is centered around three core concepts and best practices. The first core concept is creating a sense of ownership and urgency around the project. Ownership means getting others to feel they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks. Urgency means getting them to understand that the project is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along. When team members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome. Another core concept is to figure out the right combination of skills and personalities when selecting the people who will work on your team. Find people whose knowledge and skills complement one another. If your team is selected for you, see if you're able to choose who gets assigned which tasks. If that's not possible, then it's extra important for you to find ways to connect with your team. This will get them excited about the project so then they can be advocates for change when it's needed. One effective way of motivating your team is to communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project. Then you can share how you see everyone working together as a team to make it happen. Communicating this idea clearly allows others to share in your vision and take ownership in bringing it to life. The final core concept is the ever important one, effective communication. And I can't stress this enough: communication is key. Having effective communication with your team means being transparent and up front with your plans and ideas and making information available. Make sure your team, along with the rest of the organization, is kept up-to-date on your progress. This will allow everyone to feel like they're included and part of the project. Once your project is complete, you may experience some resistance or a few roadblocks. Remember, change doesn't happen overnight, so don't give up on it yet. If you do get some push-back, you can move the process along by helping folks adjust, rewarding their efforts, and reminding them of the overall value the project is providing long-term. Understanding the change process can help you determine how you can support a successful response to your project. For example, understanding the importance of communication will help you be mindful of clearly communicating project plans to your team, as well as communicating the expected impact of the project with the rest of the organization. Remember learning about Agile Project Management? Since it's a popular methodology that you'll probably use at some point, I wanted to point out that many of the principles of Agile Project Management align with successful change management. How might an Agile team approach change management, you ask? Being receptive to change is a core value in Agile teams. You will often find that they are in a state of evolution or are constantly adapting to change. If this seems like a lot to remember, no stress. We'll continue learning more about these concepts throughout the course. Just know, as the project manager, you can enact effective change management approaches in all of your interactions. In the next video, we'll discuss the differences between managing and participating in the process.

### A project manager’s role in change management

In this lesson, you’re learning about how to support the **change management** process for your project. To review, change management is the process of delivering your completed project and getting other people in the organization to adopt it. In this reading, we will discuss strategies for approaching change management as a project manager.

Your project’s success depends on the adoption and acceptance of your project—whether that entails the launch of a new external tool or a process that will change operations at a production facility. In both cases, the greatest impact of the change will be on the people who use and interact with the product or process that is changing.

For example, if your website’s user interface changes, the major impact of that change affects the user. The user must learn how the website has been reorganized and adapt to the new way to navigate it. If part of the website’s interface update includes a new brand logo, the major impact of that change impacts your organization’s employees. They must be made aware of the new logo and measures must be taken to ensure that all company communications include the new logo, not the old one.

You can help ensure your project’s success by embracing changes as they come and by convincing the wider audience, whether that is the end user or members of the organization, to embrace changes, too. When you implement a careful approach to change management, you can address issues that might occur in the later stages of your project.

**Integrating project management and change management**

Change management is a major undertaking and a project in and of itself. When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes. However, just because you're not the one directly leading the change, there are still ways in which you can support and participate in the successful adoption of your project.

As a project manager, you can think of change management as necessary for the successful outcome of your project. Both change management and project management aim to increase the likelihood of project success. They also incorporate tools and processes to accomplish that goal. The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so.

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

- How will the organization react to change?

- Which influencers can affect change?

- What are the best means of communication?

- What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project?

The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of possible scenarios and allow you to craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your project.

Let’s look at some best practices for approaching change management on your projects:

**Be proactive.** Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.

- Incorporate change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule time during team meetings or create a feedback document to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice their suggestions and concerns.

- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. You can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that any potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders.

**Communicate about upcoming changes.** Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience for end users of the project deliverables. In this way, you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch.

**Follow a consistent process.** Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. Your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process.

**Practice empathy.** Changes are inevitable, but we are often resistant to them. By being empathetic to the challenges and anxiety change can bring, you can support the process in subtle ways.

**Use tools.** Incorporating tools to assist in the adoption of a change can be very helpful. Here are a few examples you can use on your next project:

- **Feedback mechanisms,** such as surveys, can capture input from stakeholders.

- [Flowcharts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial) can visualize the project's development process.

- [Culture mapping](https://www.strategyzer.com/blog/posts/2015/10/13/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture) can illustrate the company's culture and how the company's values, norms, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.

As the project manager, you are responsible for successfully delivering projects. As you hone the skill set you acquire throughout this program, you will find that change management is essential to your projects’ success.

### Participating in change management

In the previous video, we talked about the process of change management. Change management is actually a huge undertaking and a project in itself. As mentioned, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end change management process. Instead, you may ask a member of the project team, your manager, or another senior leader to help take on that transition. If you are participating in change management, then someone else is responsible for successfully implementing the changes. Let's say you just completed the project of creating the new check-in system. The project is now at the point where it needs to be installed and adopted by the organization, but you don't have the formal authority or influence to enact this change. Your role as a project manager then doesn't include getting employees to use the new system, that's someone else's job. But just because you're not the one directly calling for, or leading the change, there's still ways in which you can and should participate. And that's what this section is about, the process of handing off the project, and the ways in which you, as the project manager who created the new system, can stay involved. Being empathetic to the challenges of change management can help you support the process in subtle ways. In this case, participating in change management might mean communicating with employees throughout the project about how the system will provide a better experience for their customers. You support the process by providing employees with information so they feel prepared to adjust to changes once the system is ready to launch. Since participating in change management is such a big part of being a successful project manager, I want to take you through a few examples so you can see how this might play out in different types of organizations. You'll see how to combine your knowledge of organizational structure and culture to make decisions about planning for the change management process. Let's explore the same pharmacy check-in project in two different organizational structures and with different team cultures to understand how these ideas are applied. Say the pharmacy chain is a Classic organizational structure and has an informal corporate culture. The final project requires a name change from the old check-in system called "Speedy Care" to the new system called "Speedy Check-in." Getting this change implemented, is an example of change management. As the project manager, you need to participate in the change management process by communicating the project needs through the appropriate channels. In this case, the chief executive officer or CEO, sends an email to the C-suite, now these are all the chief level officers in an organization. The CEO lets them know that the name must be changed and to please inform their teams to implement the name change. Since this is a Classic structure within a hierarchical organization, the budgets are managed separately, and the marketing department needs to request an extra $10,000 to change all of their printed posters for the stores. This request goes back up to the Chief Financial Officer or CFO. There may be other cost adjustments and process changes that need to happen across the organization to ensure a successful system name change. In this instance, you may need to have multiple meetings with others to help them understand what is changing, and why. Now suppose that the pharmacy chain is a Matrix organization structure and has a formal corporate culture. What does change management look like in this scenario? Well, you might meet with representatives from marketing and technology to explain the overall budget impact for all the necessary changes. With the formal culture, you might write a document that describes all budget, timeline, and training impacted by the name change. Then you might circulate that document to get feedback and alignment from all the stakeholders and share that feedback with the CEO so they can understand the full scope of the name change. The feedback and alignment from the stakeholders will tell the CEO how the change management process went. Did everyone agree on the implications? Was the feedback positive, or was there resistance? Then, when the CEO needs to communicate the name change to the entire organization, she may have someone on her team write up a formal memo that describes why the name change needs to happen and share out the memo to her staff and their teams. Keep in mind these are just examples and every organization's structure, team culture, and change management processes are going to be different. But understanding this framework can help you navigate how to effectively participate in and support change management. This understanding can allow you to ask yourself questions that will inform change management, such as how will the organization react to change? Which influencers can affect change? What are the best means of communication? What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project and so on? The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of possible scenarios, and craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your project. They will also help you navigate possible challenges along the way and lead your project through a successful change management process. I know this is a lot, but you're doing a great job. We'll continue to talk about these concepts throughout the course. So no sweat if you're still processing all this new information.

### Corporate and project governance

**Governance** in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. In simple terms, governance is understanding who is in charge. In this reading, we will discuss corporate governance and project governance. It is important to learn how corporate and project governance are related since you may have to speak about governance in an interview. Additionally, you will need to understand how your project relates to the governance structure of the organization.

**Corporate governance**

Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called **corporate governance,** and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.

Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. Think back to the previous videos on change management. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process.

Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of **steering committees.** Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project.

**Project governance**

As a project manager, you will be responsible for **project governance**. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities.

**How project and corporate governance intersect**

Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. This includes:

- Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization

- Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources

- Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders

- Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers

- During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict

- During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process

- During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge

At the same time, corporate governance can help support project governance, as it provides oversight on compliance and mitigating risk and offers guidance and direction for project managers. Good corporate governance can also help project managers secure resources, get issues addressed, avoid delays in decision-making, get buy-in from stakeholders, and achieve visibility for projects on the executive level.

**Key takeaway**

You should think about an organization’s culture and structure when you are interviewing for a new role and as you begin a new role or project. You should consider an organization’s governance processes and practices in the same way. This will help you understand how decisions are made, who is responsible for what, and what are the potential issues and areas of concern.

### How to uncover job opportunities

Starting a new career means not only developing a new skill set but also learning how to relate your previous experience and skills to the new role you’re pursuing. If you’re ready to start your journey on a new career path, this reading will help you position yourself for success in your job search. You’ll learn how to understand what your potential employer is looking for and how to connect your background to their needs. The strategies outlined below are designed to help you become a strong job candidate, even if you don’t have directly relevant experience.

The first step is to fully understand the role you’re targeting.

**Understand your target role**

One of the primary challenges for anyone looking to launch a new career is how to stand out against candidates who already have experience in the field. Overcoming this challenge begins with developing a comprehensive understanding of the role you’re targeting. You'll need to understand the role in the context of any company you’re applying to, and more broadly as well. Having a holistic understanding of what it takes to succeed in your target role will help you determine your suitability for the role, and identify any steps you can take to improve your chances of getting hired.

To understand everything from minimum must-have requirements to skills that might help you stand out from the crowd, you can begin by researching and analyzing job descriptions across different organizations.

Below you’ll find our recommended strategy for how to approach this process effectively.

**Analyze job listings**

The first part of the process is to gather information from multiple job listings:

- **Pull up ten job descriptions for your target role.** To do this, you can use job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, and LinkedIn. Make sure the roles you select come from different companies, share similar titles, and are roles you would actually apply for. In each job description, you should be able to identify a section listing requirements for the role.

- **Combine all the job requirements.** To do this, create a new Google document and copy over all the required responsibilities from all ten job descriptions.

- **Order requirements based on appearance frequency.** Certain requirements will likely appear in multiple descriptions. The more commonly they appear, the more likely it is that they’re essential for the role. Put the most frequently appearing requirements at the top of your list. For example, a requirement that appears in all ten descriptions would go at the very top.

After completing these steps, you should have a clearer picture of which requirements are most common and important for the role. You may also have questions:

- **Why do requirements differ across job descriptions?**
  One of the most common reasons for this has to do with overly general job titles, or job titles that don’t necessarily communicate the specific scope of a given role at a particular company. For example, a program manager at one company might be focused on customer management, while at another company, the emphasis might be on project management. A Data Analyst might primarily use SQL at one company and Python at another. Because of these differences, it’s important to look beyond job titles. This is why we recommend the process outlined above—to help ensure you’re targeting the exact roles that are right for you—and that you understand the requirements for those exact roles.

- **Why are some requirements higher on my list than I thought they would be, while others I expected to see barely show up at all?**
  If you’re surprised by your results, you may need to spend more time learning what the role really entails, as you may have some preconceptions about the role that require adjusting. You might also need to do additional research to ensure you’re targeting the right roles in your job search.

- **How do I know if I’m really right for my target role?**
  It’s perfectly normal to experience self-doubt at this stage of the process. Remember, this is a new career for you. You’re not expected to know everything about the role, and it’s likely that your existing skills and experience won’t line up perfectly. The more you learn about the role, the better you’ll understand what’s required for success, and the more you’ll know about how to prepare yourself for that success.

**Create your professional inventory**

For this next step, you can temporarily set aside the master list of role requirements you previously created. The focus here will be on your existing professional qualifications, and any other skills or experience you possess that might be relevant to your target role and of value to a potential employer.

To begin, assemble a comprehensive list of the following:

- **Technical (hard) skills.** These are skills relating to a specific task or situation such as programming, technical writing, project management, and more.

- **Non-technical (interpersonal) skills.** These are the skills that enable people to navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals. They include skills like communication, leadership, team management, and more.

- **Personal qualities.** These are positive attributes and personality traits such as being honest, having a good sense of humor, and being dependable. You can also include your professional interests on this list.

- **Education.** This includes any post-secondary education, certifications, or independent classes completed online or offline.

**Tip:** You do not need to limit your professional inventory to skills and qualities developed through professional experience. Consider any volunteer, extracurricular, or personal experiences that might help a hiring manager understand your capabilities.

Once you’ve created your inventory of skills and experience, you’re ready to line these up against your requirements list.

**Match your profile to the job requirements**

The concluding step in this process is to match your profile to the job requirements. The goal here is to make it easy for any hiring manager to see why you’re a great fit for their role. You’ll accomplish this by learning what to emphasize and focus on in your search, on your resume, and during interviews.

To begin, go through your professional inventory of skills and experience, highlighting each item in green, orange, or red, depending on its relevance to your target role. Relevance is determined by whether a given skill appears on your role requirements list, how high it appears on your list, and how directly it aligns with your list.

For example, let’s say you’re interested in a program manager role. If you’re skilled at using project management software, and project management software skills are high on your job requirements list, then highlight that item in green. If you have some experience with tools that do not consistently show up on job descriptions but could still be relevant, highlight these skills in orange.

- **Green** should be used for skills that are directly relevant to your target role. You should look for roles that emphasize these skills. You should also highlight these skills on your resume, and be prepared to discuss them in an interview.

- **Orange** should be used to identify those skills and experiences that are relevant for the role but not necessarily in a direct way. These are generally your transferable skills—skills that you bring with you from past experiences that can help you succeed in your new role. Plan to have to explain these to recruiters and hiring managers, as their relevance may not be immediately evident.

- **Red** should be used for items that are not relevant for your job search. De-prioritize these skills, and steer clear of highlighting them on your resume and focusing on them during interviews.

Of these three categories, the orange items are where you’ll need to focus extra attention. When it comes to transferable skills, you have to do the convincing, as you can’t count on a recruiter or hiring manager making the connection. For example, no job description for a project manager role calls for waitstaff experience. However, that project manager job description will likely mention excellent communication skills—which you would have developed during your hospitality career. When applying for the project manager role, make sure your resume specifically mentions excellent communication in addition to listing “waiter” or “waitress” as your previous occupation. Once you’ve categorized your skills and experience based on how well they align with the requirements for your target role, you’re ready to move your job search forward.

### Why is project initiation essential?

Welcome back! In the last course, you learned that initiation is the first phase within the project life cycle, followed by planning, executing, and closing. Makes sense, right? Regardless of your chosen methodology, all projects have to start somewhere. Let's talk more about initiation and why it's important for the success of a project.
Because initiation is the first phase of the project, it's really important to get it right. A well-planned initiation results in a strong foundation for your project, and sets it up for success.

Initiation begins after a problem or opportunity has been identified within an organization.
Often, stakeholders like senior leaders at a company will initiate a project to address a specific need for the business. For example, perhaps the company would like to roll out a new product, improve employee well being, or reduce costs in a certain department.

It's your responsibility as the project manager to help identify the project goals, resources, and other details based on initial discussions with the project stakeholders. Even though someone else might come up with an idea for the project, it's still your job to figure out all the important pieces that need to come together in order to get the work done.

The initiation phase is a crucial time for asking stakeholders the right questions, performing research, determining resources, and clearly documenting the key components of a project. Doing this will help you solidify the scope, or the boundary, of the project. If this seems a bit overwhelming, don't worry. We'll talk more about project scope later on in this course. If the project isn't initiated properly, things can go wrong pretty fast. For example, without sufficient understanding of the project's goals, you might underestimate what resources you need or how long the project might take. Or, without agreeing with stakeholders on what success looks like, you might think the project was completed successfully, while the stakeholders might think it didn't accomplish their goals. Getting on the same page and gaining clarity during the initiation phase can save a lot of time and extra work for everyone throughout the project. Proper initiation also helps ensure that the benefits of the project outcomes will outweigh the costs of the project. To determine this, you'll do what's called a cost benefit analysis, which is the process of adding up the expected value of a project (the benefits) and comparing them to the dollar costs. To do this, you will work with stakeholders to consider a few questions. To determine the benefits of a project, those questions might include: What value will this project create? How much money could this project save our organization? How much money will it bring in from existing customers? How much time will be saved? How will the user experience be improved? And to determine the costs of the project, those questions might include: How much time will people have to spend on this project? What will be the one-time costs? Are there any ongoing costs? What about long-term costs? The benefits of a project should always outweigh the costs, so it's really important that you consider these questions early on. Coming up, we'll talk more about the initiation phase and explore the key components of initiating a project.

### Key components of project initiation

Hello and welcome back. You just learned about the initiation phase of the project life cycle and why it's so important to get it right. Next, I'll teach you about the key components that make up initiation, and how these pieces lead to the planning phase of a project. There are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful: goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders and resources. First you need to consider the goals of the project, the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders, with your help. From there, you will begin to consider the project scope. This is the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project. You also need to think about project deliverables. They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor.

Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables the goal of your project to be achieved. Deliverables are submitted to help you reach your project goals. Also, it's important to keep in mind that the deliverables can be tangible or intangible. An example of a tangible deliverable might be submitting a chapter of a manuscript. If the goal is to publish a textbook. Or if your project goal is to finish implementation of a new point of sale software at a retail store, scheduling staff training sessions could be an intangible deliverable. Once the goals, scope and deliverables are determined, you need to consider success criteria. Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals. Another important consideration is your stakeholders. Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase.

They're the people who both have an interest in and are affected by the completion and success of a project. As a result, they're often instrumental in determining the goals, objectives, deliverables and success criteria of the project, from coming up with the idea to outlining the expectations of its results. As you move through the initiation phase, it's your job to ensure that you understand the needs of the project stakeholders early on. It's also your role to ensure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project before moving on to the next phase. Now, let's talk about resources, resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items that you will have at your disposal. It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on. No one wants to get started on a project, only to realize halfway through that they don't have enough money or enough people to complete the work. That would be a mess.

Finally, once you've established your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, it's time to create a project charter. A project charter is a document that contains all the details of the project. Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them. A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others. Once you've drafted the charter, you would then review the document with key stakeholders to get their approval to move into the planning stage. Coming up, you learn more about project charters and even get the chance to create one yourself. Hopefully you're starting to see how the key components of initiation help lay the foundation of a solid project. To quickly recap, you gather information about your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, and you document that information in the project charter. During the rest of this course, we'll talk more about each of the components outlined so far. You've come so far and learned so much, keep up the great work.

### Afsheen: Listening to learn

Hi, my name is Afsheen. I'm the Director of Core Capacity at Google, where we support some of our key products such as Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Search, and many more. Ultimately, what we're doing is we're managing the supply and demand for our products in the resource space, so specifically: compute, storage, machine learning, and networking resources. Ultimately, our goal is to provide the fuel for these products so we can support our billions of users. I often look at establishing the project goals, and tied to the goals is discussing the criteria. What's a successful project? What are the measurables involved in the project space? And lastly, I always want to look at the stakeholders that are involved—maybe our clients, our key stakeholders, and so on—and make sure that they're thought of during the formation of the project.

I'm meeting with the stakeholders, I'm trying to understand what they're trying to achieve, what we're trying to achieve, and the goal, if you will, is a critical aspect of setting the scope. When I'm trying to set the goals of a project, I apply very in depth, active listening. I'm doing a lot of socializing with other stakeholders. I'm meeting a lot of players to understand what's the landscape like. It's an active listening experience. I have a recent example of a project that in my view did not do the proper initiation phase. Last week, in fact, a group approached me with a process or a feature that they were going to launch.

I reviewed it and immediately realized that they were so far off. They had not discussed the topic with any of my team members or myself, and they were day minus one from launching the feature. It was a total miss. It really illustrates the point about when you initiate a project, you can't invest enough time in meeting with stakeholders, meeting with your colleagues, listening to them—actively listening. Someone taught me recently the value of building that "listening to learn" muscle. And in the project initiation phase, to me, that is such a valuable talent, there are those that have it, there are those that have learned it, and there those who will never do it. And I believe it's a trainable skill, but it requires you to really slow down and look at the landscape in front of you.

### Performing a cost-benefit analysis

Previously, you learned that a **cost-benefit analysis** is the process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs. In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate return on investment (ROI).

**The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis**

A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.

**Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis**

When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

- What value will this project create? 

- How much money could this project save our organization? 

- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?

- How much time will it save? 

- How will it improve the customer experience?

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

- How much time will people have to spend on this project?

- What are the one-time costs?

- Are there any ongoing costs?

- What about long-term costs?

You might also consider questions about **intangible benefits.** These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

- **Customer satisfaction.** Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 

- **Employee satisfaction**. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 

- **Employee productivity**. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?

- **Brand perception.** Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider **intangible costs**. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.

**Calculating costs and benefits**

The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment, or ROI. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:

![5WgkcOwJRaqoJHDsCRWqcg_17254e77f84d45a89ab513f21eef88d9_ROI-formula](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5WgkcOwJRaqoJHDsCRWqcg_17254e77f84d45a89ab513f21eef88d9_ROI-formula.png?expiry=1662076800000&hmac=3uAHPijeSdYhSAejrlozrE0aA77tax64nKaWPGksJcI)

In this formula, **G** represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

**Key takeaway**

Performing a cost-benefit analysis can help you and your stakeholders determine if it makes sense to take on a new project by evaluating if its benefits outweigh its costs. When conducting cost-benefit analyses for your prospective projects, you can use the guiding questions and ROI formula provided in this reading as a reference.

### Wrap-up

Nice work! You're on your way to becoming a great candidate for roles in project management. We're so glad you've stuck with us, and we hope you're proud of the progress you've made so far.

In the last few videos, we've given you a primer on kicking off a project successfully. To recap, you learned more about initiation,the first phase of the project life cycle. Hopefully, you're starting to see how important this phase is for the overall health of a project. As we talked about earlier, a lack of preparation during the initiation stage can lead to problems later on in the project life cycle, like a budget shortage, a missed deadline, or too few teammates to complete the work. But with early planning, you can set your team up for success. We also introduced you to the major factors you should consider during the initiation phase, including goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders and resources. All of these come together in the early plans for a project and are documented in a project charter. Now that you understand the basic elements of initiation, let's dive deeper. Next up, we'll talk about identifying goals and deliverables and learn more about measurement and success criteria. You're doing great, and we'll see you soon.

## WEEK 2

## Identifying project goals

### Introduction: Defining project goals, scope, and success criteria

Welcome back. By now you should have a better sense of how the different parts of the initiation come together to form the beginnings of a project. So far, you've outlined the key components of project initiation and, most importantly, you've learned that a lack of preparation during this stage can lead to problems later on. We're going to continue honing your project preparation skills.

Once we're done here, you'll be able to define and create project goals and deliverables, the guiding stars of your project. You'll also be able to define project scope, the boundaries of your project, that state what is and is not part of your project. You'll be able to identify what's in-scope and out-of-scope for a project and you'll be able to recognize scope creep, something you'll need to keep a close eye on to help you reach your project goal. Finally, you'll be able to explain different ways of defining and measuring your project's success criteria.

Before we get started, I'd like to talk through an example that we'll follow for the rest of this course. Imagine that you're the lead project manager at Office Green, a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The Director of Product at Office Green has an idea for a new service called Plant Pals to offer high-volume customers small, low-maintenance plants, like little cacti and leafy ferns, for their desks. As the project manager, you've been tasked with managing the roll out of this new service.

As we go through this course, we'll return to your role as the project manager at Office Green, to help teach you about project goals, deliverables, and success criteria. You'll also see the role your team and stakeholders play in creating and following these three important components. At the end, you'll compile everything you've learned into a shared document that you can use as a portfolio to share with future employers. After this course, you'll move on to the next phases of the project life cycle, and so will your Office Green project. Enjoy.

### Determining project goals and deliverables

Welcome back. In this video, I'll define project goals and deliverables and explain why they're important. Then I'll teach you how to determine whether a goal or deliverable has been well-defined, which means it's got enough detail and information to guide you towards success. First things first, to set up a project for success, and to make your job easier, you want to figure out what needs to be done before you actually get started. You need to define exactly what your goals and deliverables are, so that you'll be able to tell your team members what to do. You need a clear picture of what you're trying to accomplish, how you're going to accomplish it, and how you know when it has been accomplished. Let's define project goals so that you can start to figure out what your project team needs to reach it.

The project goal is the desired outcome of the project. It's what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. For example, your goal could be to improve the response time to customer inquiries via email by 20 percent. The goal of your Office Green project might be to increase revenue by five percent through a new service called Plant Pals that offers desk plants to top customers by the end of the year. Goals are important because they give you a roadmap to your destination. Without a clear goal in mind, how can you know where to go or how to get there? Now, one of the biggest differences between what makes a good goal and a not-so-good goal is how well it's defined. Meaning: how clear and specific is the goal. If the goal is your destination, are you confident you'll know when you've arrived? The examples I mentioned before, to improve the response time to customer inquiries via email by 20 percent, and to increase the Office Green revenue by five percent are two well-defined goals because they tell you what you're trying to achieve. But wait, there's more.

These goals also tell you how to do what you've been asked to do. In this case, it's via email and through a new service offering, and that's not all. These goals clarify the goal even further by saying "to improve by 20 percent and increase by five percent." Now we know where we're going. Well-defined goals are both specific and measurable. They give you a clear sense of what you are trying to accomplish. Really great goals have even more detail, but I'll get to that soon. When you start a project, take time to review your goals and make sure they're well-defined. To do this, you might need to get more information from your stakeholders. Talk to them about their vision for the project. Ask how this aligns to the company's larger goals and mission. By the end of that conversation, you and your stakeholders should agree to support the project goals in order to avoid running into issues later on.

Here's an example from my own experience as a project manager. Our team had finished a new product feature. Our stated goal was to deliver an early version of this feature and collect user feedback. When we delivered the feature to one of our key customers for user feedback, the customer didn't have anyone available to try it out. Our team debated whether or not we had met the goal if we hadn't collected user feedback. Some felt that we hadn't achieved the stated goal while others thought we did. The customer was satisfied with our team's ability to deliver a feature in the timeline stated. But our internal team, wasted valuable time going back and forth about it. That said, make sure that before you start your project, you, your stakeholders, and your team are all clear on the project goals so that you know you're making the right kind of progress. I'll teach you a process for how to do this coming up.

Once you have the goals nailed down, it's time to examine the project deliverables. Project deliverables are the products or services that are created for the customer, client, or project sponsor. In other words, a deliverable is what gets produced or presented at the end of a task, event, or process. Take the goal to improve customer response time. the deliverable for that goal could be the creation of email templates for responding to typical questions. Your Office Green project goal to increase revenues could have these two deliverables: launching the plant service and a finished website that highlights the new kinds of plants being offered. These are considered deliverables because they describe tangible outputs that show stakeholders how additional revenues will be generated.

There are all sorts of project deliverable examples. A pretty common one is a report. When a goal is reached, you can visibly see the results documented in the chart, graph, or presentation. Deliverables help us quantify and realize the impact of the project. Just like needing well-defined goals, you need well-defined deliverables for pretty much the same reasons. Deliverables are usually decided upfront with the stakeholders or clients involved in the project. They hold everyone accountable and are typically a big part of achieving the goal. Make sure to ask questions about what the deliverable should be and have everyone share their vision and expectations of the deliverables so that you're all on the same page. Coming up, you'll practice the art of defining your goals even further following the SMART method. Enjoy.

### Leading the initiation phase - Interactive infographic

**Project Plant Pals: Initiation**

In upcoming activities, you will work with stakeholders to set goals, roles, and deliverables for Project Plant Pals. Explore an infographic to find out more about what’s next in the initiation phase.

**Understand the initiation phase**

Select the label in each infographic to learn about the initiation phase for Project Plant Pals.

- **Refine goals with stakeholders** First, you will meet with the Director of Product (the project sponsor) to discuss their aims for the project. To clarify these goals and keep the project on track, you’ll turn them into SMART goals.

- **Assess stakeholder power and influence** Next, you’ll get to know some of your stakeholders and find out how they fit into the project. A stakeholder analysis and power grid will help you decide how best—and how often—to communicate with team members, investors, and more.

- **Assign roles and responsibilities to promote the service** To promote Plant Pals, you’ll assemble teams to plan the marketing and sales strategy and redesign the website. You’ll use RACI charts to determine who should be responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed about various project tasks.

- **Create a charter for the next stage of the project** As you wrap up the initiation phase, your focus will shift to internal operations. You’ll create a project charter to guide your team as they plan training, fulfillment, and delivery procedures for Plant Pals.

### How to set SMART goals

Welcome back, by now you know that goals are important to the success of your project, and you know that they need to be well-defined in order to help keep your project on track. Since your deliverables depend on your goals, it's in your best interest to get those goals as well- defined as possible. Lucky for you, I've got an easy method for doing just that: setting SMART goals. I already mentioned that goals should be specific and measurable. The SMART method to evaluate goals add three more considerations for success. Be attainable, be relevant, and be time-bound. Put them all together, and what do you have? SMART goals. As an entry-level project manager, you may or may not be setting the project's main goals, but you will need to be able to identify and clarify them as needed, and that's where the SMART method can be a valuable tool. Let's take a closer look at each term.

As I've already mentioned, if your goal is not specific, you'll have trouble figuring out how long it should take to complete and whether or not you've accomplished it. For example, if the goal is simply to improve customer service response time, that's not very specific. It does tell you what you want to achieve in general, but it doesn't say anything else. If you improve response time by one percent, is that enough? If after five years response time finally goes up, is that enough? How about if only half of your staff improves their response times, but the other half stays the same. Specific goals should answer at least two of the questions I'm about to ask. What do I want to accomplish? Why is this a goal? Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit? Who is involved? Who is the recipient? Employees, customers, the community at large? Where should the goal be delivered? Finally, to what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints? Next, we want to set goals that are measurable, meaning we can determine that they were objectively met.

Measuring is not only a way for people to track progress, but also a tool to help people stay motivated. You can tell the goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished? Sometimes the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no. Did you learn to play the guitar, yes or no? You will need to measure most of the goals you have with metrics. Metrics, what you use to measure something like numbers or figures. For example, if your goal was to run a five kilometer race, then distance in kilometers is your metric. At Office Green, the project goal is to increase revenue by five percent. In this case, revenue is the metric. Lastly, consider benchmarks or points of reference to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics. For instance, if your overall goal is to increase revenue, you can look at last year's data as a benchmark for deciding how much to increase revenue this year. If last year's revenue increased by three percent, then an increase by five percent in a booming economy would be a reasonable goal for this year. Ok, so the goal is specific and measurable, but is it attainable? Can it reasonably be reached based on the metrics? Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to encourage growth, otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change?

However, you don't want it to be too extreme or you'll never reach it. You'll have failed before you even started. Aim to find a balance between the two extremes. For example, let's take the goal to run a 5K. Say you regularly run 2.5 kilometers, three times a week. An attainable goal will be to go from running 2.5 kilometers to running five kilometers within four weeks. An unattainable goal might be earning first-place in the 5K. I mean, it could happen, but it's not likely, especially if you've never run a race before. But how can you know if a goal is attainable, if it's unfamiliar? A clue to helping you figure out if your goal is attainable, is to ask: how can it be accomplished? Break down the goal into smaller parts and see if it makes sense. Going from 2.5 kilometers to five kilometers over four weeks means increasing your distance by a little over half a kilometer each week. That's not so bad, use the same process on your Office Green project goal. Businesses usually conduct quarterly reviews. So let's assume that increase is expected to occur over the course of a year or four quarters. In order to meet the goal, you need to see an increase of at least 1.25 percent each quarter, seems pretty reasonable to me. What wouldn't be reasonable is setting a goal of increasing revenues by 50 percent or 100 percent, unless your research showed that business was improving that quickly. Your goal is specific, measurable, and attainable.

Now let's see if it's relevant. In other words, does it make sense to try and reach this goal? Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities and values. Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? Does it match your organizations' other needs and priorities? Everyone, from the client, the project team, and the people who will ultimately use the product, need to feel like the goal is worth supporting. Also, consider the timing. Both the amount of time the project will take, as well as the larger economic and social contexts can have big impacts. There might be a budget to complete the project now, but will the company be able to sustain the project over time? Is there an audience that will continue to use the product or service once it's delivered? Once you've got the answers to these questions, you should have a clear goal to help steer the project. If you still don't feel confident about the project's goals, keep digging.

It's okay to ask questions if you have doubts. Communicate your concerns with the project senior stakeholders and your direct supervisor if you have one. They should be able to address some of your concerns so that you can feel confident about moving forward. If you're feeling good about the project being relevant and attainable, and you've made sure it's measurable, and has the specifics to keep you and your team focused the final item on the checklist is to make sure it's time-bound. Time-bound means your goal has a deadline. Deadlines give you a way to track your progress, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started. Time and metrics often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric. Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time. For example, if you need to increase revenues by the end of the year, you can break down how much you need to increase each quarter, month, and week, and there you have it. Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound: a nearly foolproof method to create and evaluate project goals. You know what they say, work smarter, not harder. As we continue in this module, you'll learn about project scope and see how having clear goals supports all other decisions that come up during a project.

### SMART goals: Making goals meaningful

In this lesson you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. Now, let's focus on SMART goals.

Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms.

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below:

![6OlXlIjhSLmpV5SI4Vi5_A_05b70303b9a6415cb209eba399439e10_C2M2L1R1-01](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6OlXlIjhSLmpV5SI4Vi5_A_05b70303b9a6415cb209eba399439e10_C2M2L1R1-01.png?expiry=1662249600000&hmac=sgzy2FSSFqsHchENFWwxXesoNjG9wAEcDTZ3Lm9WSeA)

- **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret.

- **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.

- **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.

- **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.

- **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.

**Focusing on the "M" in SMART**

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for **measurable**. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders.

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.

**Defining a SMART goal**

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can **measure** the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your **specific** goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal **attainable** by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is **relevant** because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal **time-bound** by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.

**Key takeaway**

Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.

### Navigating Peer/Self Reviews

Hello again. Throughout the program, you have the chance to practice project management skills in a few different ways. In addition to multiple choice and short answer quizzes, you complete hands on activities to apply what you've learned. You'll solve common project problems in real world situations and create the kinds of artifacts project managers use every day. Completing these hands on activities is really important to your success in this program. They'll give you practical experience that can help you describe your skills in interviews or use them to manage projects more effectively in your personal or professional life.

To help you prepare, I'll introduce you to two different types of hands on activities that we prepared for you. I'll also share some tips and tricks that will let you get the most out of them. And one type of activity, you review a project management scenario and follow step by step instructions to move the project forward. Your job could be to learn about stakeholders, assigned task owners or organized documents, so they're easy to find. You can recognize these exercises as quizzes with activity in the title. When you finish an activity, we'll take you through an exemplar of the completed assignment that you can compare to your own work. Be sure to review these exemplars carefully, so you know what you did well and how you can improve next time.

Keep in mind that some activities can have more than one right answer, just like real problems can have more than one solution. The exemplars for these activities explain one way of doing things, but they also point out where you could do things differently. This helps you check your approach to an assignment, not just your answers. Certain activities also include quiz questions that help you check your work. These quizzes can be graded or ungraded and give you another way to measure your progress and expand your knowledge. Another type of hands on activity is the peer review or peer graded assignment. These activities follow a similar format to the first, you will review of project management scenario and complete a set of step by step instructions.

But there's one major difference, your classmates will grade your assignment and you'll grade theirs. For each peer review, you need to grade at least two submissions, but you can grade more if you want. This peer grading process is a key part of the learning experience for this program. That's because it gives you objective feedback on your work and let you know how others are approaching the same challenges. Peer grading gives you the chance to learn not just from us, the instructors but from each other as well. To grade each other's work, you will use what's known as a rubric, a rubric as a checklist of items your assignment must include, with each item worth a certain number of points. You typically need to score at least 80% correct to pass a peer graded assignment.

So for example if a rubric has 10 points, you need a minimum of 8 points to pass. In addition to using these rubrics to grade your peers, you can review them before you submit your own assignments, so you understand how you'll be graded. Peer grading is also important because it lets you give and receive qualitative feedback. For example, if a peer does well, you could tell them they did a great job refining a goal or that you like their creative solution to a problem. Positive feedback helps you and your peers learn about your strength and motivates you to do your best work. On the other hand, it's just as important if not more so to learn from your mistakes.

If a peer get something wrong, be sure to leave thoughtful, constructive feedback, so they understand why they didn't get full credit. That way, they'll know what to review and how to improve, so they can become better project managers. And don't worry, we'll give you some tips on how to leave constructive feedback for each activity. Peer review is a valuable tool, but unlike other assessments in the program, it may take some time to receive your grades. Remember that real people aren't as fast as computers, so we can take up to 10 days for grades to appear. Additionally, it can take some time before their assignments available for you to grade.

Be patient, your peers may be working through the course at a different pace and remember you can always move on to other items in the course and come back if you need to. If for any reason you aren't able to access a peer submission or if a submission is incomplete, you can skip it and go to a different one. To learn how to do this, continue onto the optional reading. This reading will also tell you more about the peer review process and link you to helpful resources on topics like where to find your feedback and how to change your sharing settings and google docs. So be sure to check it out. Great. Now that you know more about some of the hands on activities to find throughout the program, you're ready to get started.

### Optional: What to know about peer-graded assignments

Throughout this course, you will complete a few different types of hands-on activities that let you apply your project management skills in “real-world” situations. These assignments ask you to think through common project management problems, find solutions, and create essential project management artifacts.

For some of these assignments, you’ll need to submit your work for other learners to grade. This peer review process is a central part of the learning experience. It allows you to assess activities objectively against a set rubric, and compare your approach with those of your peers. It also gives you the option to give and receive qualitative feedback.

You’ll need to complete peer-graded assignments in each course, so here’s what you need to know:

**How peer-grading works**

Before submitting the activity, you can check your work against a list of required items it should contain. Review this list carefully and revise your work before submitting, if necessary. This list matches the rubric your peers will use to grade your assignment (and that you will use to grade theirs).

You should receive grades from at least two peers for each peer-graded assignment you complete. As a grader, you can review as many submissions as you like, but you must mark at least two assignments to move on in the course.

**Optional feedback**

When grading a peer’s assignment, you will have the option to give qualitative feedback. We encourage you to leave thoughtful comments about what they did well and where they can improve. This feedback can help you and your peers understand why you lost points for certain rubric items, so you can do better next time. Each assignment includes tips and examples of good feedback to help you write constructive comments.

**Submitting your work**

Most assignments involve submitting documents or spreadsheets for review. You have the option to submit your peer-graded assignments as either a URL (to a shared Google doc for example) or as a downloadable file (like a .docx file). To grade your work, your peer reviewers will access the shared doc or download the file you submitted.

Coursera automatically assigns you a personalized deadline for each assignment in the course. Make note of this date and aim to submit your work on time—the earlier, the better. You are more likely to get timely feedback if you turn in your assignment a day or two before the deadline.

**What to do if you don’t receive a grade**

If you submitted your assignment as a URL, and no one has reviewed it after a few days, check your Google sharing settings to ensure “view” access is enabled. (Visit [this resource](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/resources/FOW2Z) to learn more about file sharing.)

If your share settings are correct and you still haven’t received a grade (or if you need assignments to grade yourself), you have two options:

1. Check when you submitted your assignment. It can take up to a week for grades to appear, so you may need to wait a little longer. New graders and assignments should be available within a few days.

2. Ask for reviewers (or items to review) in the discussion forums. Posts like this are common, so you can post your submission link for peers to review, or skim through forum posts to find items to grade.

**What to do if you need a new assignment to grade**

Sometimes, while you’re grading your peers, you may find you aren’t able to access or open a file. If you can’t grade an assignment for any reason, you can skip it and move on to a different submission. To do this, select Flag this submission (located at the upper-right corner of the prompt box in the grading pane):

![qD994MNKRNS_feDDSkTUmA_9eb25b16dbad4ba496d827fa29302bf1_flag-submission](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qD994MNKRNS_feDDSkTUmA_9eb25b16dbad4ba496d827fa29302bf1_flag-submission.png?expiry=1662336000000&hmac=3TsMylb6XY8YF14_q875xu13BTt9AGZ5bIvHSCOUWK8)

You will be prompted to select a reason for the flag and provide an explanation in the text box:

![dhremm49RNma3ppuPcTZjQ_87365a44c7924cda885c26d73585d7f1_flag-submission-access](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/dhremm49RNma3ppuPcTZjQ_87365a44c7924cda885c26d73585d7f1_flag-submission-access.png?expiry=1662336000000&hmac=EbSE76MZPrJt-cdUa5WtK8iRI3qLCtKVhJzkxKWW4Co)

Once you select Send report, you'll receive a confirmation message and a different submission will appear below.

**Note:** _Flagging a learner's submission as inaccessible will not affect their grade._

### Activity Overview

In this activity, you will analyze a scenario to identify project goals. Then, you will write the goals using SMART criteria.

As a reminder, SMART goals must be:

- Specific:

- Measurable

- Attainable:

- Relevant

- Time-bound

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.

Office Green’s main goal for this project is: “Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to high-volume clients.”

You recently met with the project sponsor (the Director of Product) to discuss two additional goals for the Plant Pals project:

1. Boost Office Green’s brand awareness

2. Raise Office Green’s customer retention rate

In order to help your team achieve these two additional project goals, you need to turn them into SMART goals. The notes from your meeting with the Director of Product are below. You can use this information to create SMART goals:

- Office Green’s customer retention rate was 80% last year, but the CEO wants that number to increase by at least 10% this year.

- Last year, 70% of customers who left Office Green for competitors said they did so because they wanted more extensive services. When surveyed, 85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals.

- The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year—a slight increase over last year. The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years.

- The company plans to create an Operations and Training plan for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.

- Office Green will promote the new service with a new marketing and sales strategy, a redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page, and a print catalog.

- With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their customer base will grow by at least 15%.

- Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from 15K to 13K visits each month. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to increase by at least 2K each month by the end of the year, which is in line with the results of prior marketing campaigns.

- The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter. (It is currently the start of Q1.)

**Step 1: Access the template**

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Link to template: [Activity template: SMART project goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_oZQRDVfJbD0LPbcTBzjMUdz_DzA-Q1fq6id02XimQA/edit)

**Step 2: Revise the goals to be SMART**

The template contains the two additional project goals for Plant Pals, neither of which meets all the SMART criteria:

1. “Office Green will boost brand awareness”

2. “Office Green will raise their customer retention rate”

Turn these two goals into SMART goals using the information from the scenario above. Write the revised goals next to **SMART Goal One** and **SMART Goal Two**. Your goals should be complete, but brief—one or two sentences is enough.

For example, here is a goal that’s missing some of the SMART criteria:

“Office Green will soon create an app to help customers care for their plants.”

That’s not a bad start, but it isn’t specific, measurable, or time-bound. Here’s the same goal, rewritten as a SMART goal:

“Office Green will create an app that offers tips and reminders to help customers care for their plants. The app will be completed within 18 months and be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells.”

**Step 3: Explain what makes each goal SMART**

Now that you’ve rewritten the goals, explain what makes them SMART by answering the following questions:

1. What makes the goal **specific**? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?

2. What makes the goal **measurable**? Does it include metrics to gauge success?

3. What makes the goal **attainable**? Is it realistic given available time and resources?

4. What makes the goal **relevant**? Does it support project or business objectives?

5. What makes the goal **time-bound**?Does it include a timeline or deadline?

Be specific in your answers. For instance, the plant care app SMART goal is:

**Specific:** The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so.

**Measurable:** The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.

**Attainable:** The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app.

**Relevant:** Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully.

**Time-bound:** The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

If you find that either goal does not meet all the SMART criteria, try revising it and answering the questions again.

### Activity Exemplar: Define and determine SMART project goals

Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations for the activity.

**Completed Exemplar**

To view the exemplar for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Link to exemplar: [SMART goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkYyqKMh5Whra335r-N46dZhDs7d2ZNF4FWhWF6PVj8/edit)

**Assessment of Exemplar**

Compare the exemplar to your completed SMART goals activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

**Note:** Your SMART goals may differ from the exemplar in some ways. That’s okay—what’s important is that your goals meet as many of the SMART criteria as possible.

Let’s review each SMART goal:

**SMART goal one**

The original goal indicates that Office Green will boost its overall brand awareness through Plant Pals, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

“Office Green will boost brand awareness with a new marketing and sales strategy and website update that will increase page views by 2K per month by the end of the year.”

- **Specific:** Office Green will update their website and launch a new marketing and sales strategy to boost awareness of their brand.

- **Measurable:** The goal includes a metric of 2K new page views per month.

- **Attainable:** They have a year to reach this goal and the target of 2K new page views per month is in line with prior marketing campaigns.

- **Relevant:** Greater brand awareness can mean new customers, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound:** The deadline is at the end of the year.

**SMART goal two**

The original goal indicates that Office Green will raise their customer retention rate, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

“Office Green will raise their overall customer retention rate by 10% by the end of the year by implementing a new Operations & Training plan for the Plant Pals service.”

- **Specific:** Office Green will implement an Operations & Training plan that will improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency. 

- **Measurable:** The goal includes a metric of a 10% increase in retention. 

- **Attainable:** They have a year to reach this goal and many former and existing customers are interested in the new service. It has the potential to help them keep customers who may be thinking about leaving for a landscaper with more services.

- **Relevant:** Increasing customer retention can lead to more sales, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound:** The deadline is at the end of the year.

### Introduction to OKRs

So far you've been learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. As you broaden your understanding of project management and the different tools available to help you succeed, I want to teach you about a popular tool used in many organizations and here at Google: objectives and Key results, or OKRs. In this video, I'll discuss what OKRs are, how they are used by organizations, and how they help focus a team's time and effort on activities that drive success. You've just learned about, and practiced, the SMART method for defining project goals. Like the SMART method, OKRs help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project or person. OKRs take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome. They not only state clearly what the goal is, they provide specific details that allow you to measure the success of the goal. One way to think about OKRs is that they separate the different components of SMART goals and clarify them even further, rather than grouping everything into one statement.

Let's break this down. The O stands for objective, and defines what needs to be achieved. It describes the desired result or outcome, such as an increase in customer retention, or an improvement on the employee onboarding process. KR stands for key results. These are the measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met. For example, if your objective is to improve customer retention, then the key result might be to have 90 percent customer satisfaction rating by the end of the first quarter. Recall that one of the SMART criteria is attainability, which means it's practical to achieve the goal. Key results, however, should be a little more ambitious. Here at Google, we actually use OKRs to set stretch goals as a way to challenge ourselves to do something we haven't accomplished before. If we actually accomplish all of our key results, we may have made our OKRs a bit too easy.

Let's review quickly. Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome. Key results define how you'll know whether or not you've met your objective. How do OKRs work in practice? How do you use them to manage a project? Organizations often set OKRs at different levels, such as the company level, department or team level, and project level. Company-level OKRs are commonly shared across an organization so that everyone is clear on the company's goals. They are usually updated on an annual basis to help drive the organization in the direction it wants to go. These high-level OKRs support the mission of the organization. Project-level OKRs should support and be aligned with company-level OKRs. An example of a company-level objective at Office Green increase customer retention by adapting to the changing workplace environment.

This is a big, aspirational goal that applies to the entire company and all of its endeavors. In order to focus their efforts to reach this objective, Office Green might develop key results that include 95 percent of phone, chat, and email customer support tickets are resolved during the first contact. Top three most requested new offerings for distributed office environments are in pilot by the end of the second quarter, and sales and support channels are available 24/7 by the end of the year. Some of these company-level key results could become the basis for projects. For example, the key result, "top three most requested new offerings for distributed office environments that are in pilot by the end of the second quarter," could become the Plant Pals project.

Team or department-level OKRs, support the company's broader OKRs and help drive team performance. Departments may develop OKRs that are more specific to their job function as well. For example, the company-level key result "sales and support channels are available 24/7 by the end of the year," could lead to a related sales department objective like: increase the sales team presence nationwide. And the key result: new sales offices are open in 10 cities by the end of the year. Project-level OKRs are set during the initiation phase to help define measurable project goals. They're tracked throughout the planning and execution stages to measure project success. Project-level OKRs need to align with and support both company and department-level OKRs. For example, in order to align with Office Green's company-wide objective to increase customer retention by adapting to the changing workplace environment, a project objective for Plant Pals might be to enroll existing customers in the Plant Pals service.

A key result for this objective might be 25 percent of existing customers sign up for the Plant Pals pilot. Let's recap. OKR stands for objectives and key results. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome. Key results define how you will measure the outcome of your objective. Company-level OKRs are shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach its goals. Project-level OKRs help define measurable project goals. They need to align with and support both company and departmental-level OKRs. Great. Now that you have a better idea of what OKRs are and how they function, you can practice creating OKRs on your own.

### Creating OKRs for your project

_In this lesson, you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. This reading will focus on creating effective objectives and key results (OKRs) and how to implement them into your project._

**What are OKRs?**

OKR stands for objectives and key results. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.

![jptC7Ol7TyWbQuzpe_8lBA_03179af1c1574fc6ac2efe06c12a08f1_OKRs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jptC7Ol7TyWbQuzpe_8lBA_03179af1c1574fc6ac2efe06c12a08f1_OKRs.png?expiry=1662422400000&hmac=IPTajdRloy_SrTh6TRkmMrnr8i7ujANudapcN0kmNdY)

Company-wide OKRs are used to set an ultimate goal for an entire organization, while team, department, and project-level OKRs describe the focused results each group will need to achieve in order to support the organization.

**OKRs and project management**

As a project manager, OKRs can help you expand upon project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project to accomplish those goals. Project-level OKRs help establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives. You can also create and use project-level OKRs to help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable.

**Creating OKRs for your project**

- _Set your objectives_

Project objectives should be aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project and determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3–6 months.

_Examples:_

- Build the most secure data security software

- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions

- Provide a top-performing service

- Make a universally-available app

- Increase market reach

- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region

Strong _objectives_ meet the following criteria. They are:

- Aspirational

- Aligned with organizational goals

- Action-oriented

- Concrete

- Significant

To help shape each objective, ask yourself and your team:

- Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals?

- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?

- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?

- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

- _Develop key results_

Next, add 2–3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound. They can be used to indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project. They should also challenge you and your team to stretch yourselves to achieve more.

_Examples:_

- X% new signups within first quarter post launch

- Increase advertiser spend by X%

- New feature adoption is at least X%

- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported by customers per Sprint

- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X%

Strong _key results_ meet the following criteria:

- Results-oriented—_not_ a task

- Measurable and verifiable

- Specific and time-bound

- Aggressive yet realistic

To help shape your key results, ask yourself and your team the following:

- What does success mean?

- What metrics would prove that we’ve successfully achieved the objective?

**OKR development best practices**

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:

- Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it.

- As a general rule, try to develop around 2–-3 key results for each objective.

- Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.

**OKRs versus SMART goals**

Earlier in this lesson, you learned how to craft SMART goals for your project. While SMART goals and OKRs have some similarities, there are key differences, as well. The following article describes how SMART goals and OKRs are similar, how they differ, and when you might want to use one or the other: [Understanding the Unique Utility of OKRs vs. SMART Goals](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/okr-vs-smart-goals)

### Optional Activity: Create OKRs for your project

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will practice creating OKRs (objectives and key results) for a project. OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome, while key results define how you will measure that outcome.

As a project manager, creating OKRs can help you clarify both your overall project goals and the deliverables you’ll need to accomplish those goals. You can also create project-level OKRs to help motivate your team.

When you finish the activity, we'll take you through an exemplar of the completed assignment that you can compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. Be sure to review these exemplars carefully, so you know what you did well and how you can improve next time. Keep in mind that some activities can have more than one right answer, just like real problems can have more than one solution. The exemplars for these activities explain one way of doing things, but they also point out where you could do things differently. This helps you check your approach to an assignment, not just your answers.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Wonder City is a mid-sized city where increasing growth and traffic are impacting quality of life. According to a recent market assessment, the region’s population is expected to double in the next five years. Job growth is also expected to increase by 48%. This growth will impact street networks, parking and mobility.

Wonder City has several city-wide objectives related to reducing traffic congestion and improving the city’s infrastructure. In order to support these city-wide objectives, the Wonder City Transportation Authority (WCTA) will be launching five new bus lines. This initiative has been nicknamed Project Move It.

You have been hired as the project manager for this initiative. As the project manager, you will set OKRs to help clarify the project goals and define what needs to be done in order to deliver a successful project.

Here is some additional information about the project:

**Step 2: Draft your first objective**

A list of objectives for Project Move It have been provided for you below. Select one and add it next to “O1” on the first line of the OKR card.

Potential objectives for Project Move It:

- Actively and meaningfully engage the public to generate buy-in and project support.

- Make it easy to get around the greater Wonder City area via public transportation.

- Promote public transportation as a convenient alternative to driving.

- Provide a reliable and consistent public transportation service.

Or, if you prefer, you may draft your own objective based on the scenario.

Remember that effective objectives are:

- **Aspirational:** Is the objective challenging and inspiring?

- **Aligned with company goals:** Does the objective support company and/or departmental OKRs?

- **Action-oriented:** Does the objective motivate the team to take initiative?

- **Concrete:** Can the project team easily grasp the objective?

- **Significant:** Will achieving the objective make a meaningful impact or change from where you are currently?

For example, if the objective of an educational technology company was to provide products that consistently meet new educational standards, a project objective might be: “Successfully launch version 2.0 of our early learning app in time for the national curriculum conference.”

**Step 3: Add key results**

Next, write at least three key results for your objective next to “KR1,” “KR2,” and “KR3.” (You may add up to five key results for each objective, but only three are required for this activity.)

Each key result should address the following questions:

- Does the key result help define success for your team?

- Can it be measured to prove that you’ve achieved your objective?

- Is it specific and time-bound?

- Is it ambitious yet realistic?

Your key results should build on the scenario and additional project information, but it’s up to you to determine your success criteria. As an example, let’s return to the objective, “Successfully launch version 2.0 of our early learning app.” If you knew that a successful launch meant getting new users to download the app, you could create any of the following key results for the objective:

- 15,000 new downloads within first quarter post launch

- 75,000 new downloads within first year post launch

- 25% of monthly downloads from new customers

Remember: OKRs are never set in stone--they can and should be revised as you make progress, so it’s okay if you need to adjust your key results later on.

**Step 4: Write 1-3 more OKRs**

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a second, third and fourth objective to fill up the template.

**Pro Tip: Save the template**

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the OKR template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

**What to Include in Your Response**

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed OKR card:

- The objective defines what needs to be achieved and describes a desired outcome

- The key results are ambitious, specific, measurable, and define success for the objective

### Optional Activity Exemplar: Create OKRs for your project

Here is a completed exemplar along with an explanation of how the exemplar fulfills the expectations for the activity.

**Completed Exemplar**

Click the link to create a copy of the exemplar. If you don’t have a Google account, download the exemplar directly from the attachment below.

Link to exemplar: [Activity Exemplar: Project OKRs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1alp9qY_-nIZ2f9zCRMZ5TMytQyttsxh8bo4YjNFjaMw/edit#heading=h.np209ztjhxac)

**Assessment of Exemplar**

Compare the exemplar to your completed OKRs. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

**Note:** The exemplar gives three key results for each objective, but there are many more you could develop. Because you can measure success in various ways, your lists of key results may differ. The important thing to keep in mind is that your OKRs should help you expand upon your project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project in order to accomplish those goals.

Let’s review each OKR in the exemplar:

**OKR #1: Actively and meaningfully engage the public to generate buy-in and project support**

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “400 attendees to 12 public meetings focused on transit talks” measures engagement in the number of attendees at public meetings about transit.

**OKR #2: Make it easy to get around the greater Wonder City area via public transportation.**

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “New ridership increases by 25% within three months” measures the increase in bus ridership in the city in response to the community’s improved ability to get around the city with ease.

**OKR #3: Promote public transportation as a convenient alternative to driving.**

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “80% click-through rate from banner ads on social media” measures the success of the promotional campaign in public engagement with social media ads.

**OKR #4: Provide a reliable and consistent public transportation service.**

Each key result uses measurable data to define success for the objective. For example, “100% of new busses meet government safety standards at monthly inspections” measures the reliability and consistency of busses that pass regular safety inspections.

## Defining project scope

### Determining a project's scope

Project scope is a really important concept that I want to tell you about. You'll hear it come up time and time again throughout each phase of the project life cycle. In fact, you may even find yourself defending it, so let's get acquainted with scope. In this video, you will learn how to define and determine scope. Simply put, your project scope includes the boundaries of a project. The way we define it at Google is "an agreed upon understanding as to what is included or excluded from a project." Scope helps ensure that your project is clearly defined and mapped out. That means knowing exactly who the project will be delivered to and who will be using the end result of the project. You also need a firm understanding of the project's complexity. Is it straightforward with an easily manageable list of tasks? Or will it require extensive research, multiple rounds of approvals, and a large-scale production process that will take years to complete? Scope also includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.

You need to clearly define these so that you can make sure you're working within those boundaries and what's actually possible for the project to work. Poorly-defined scope or major changes to your scope can cause changes to the budget, timeline, or even final outcome of the project. Let's look at the scope of your Office Green project as an example. As a reminder, the new Plant Pals service offers customers small, low-maintenance, plants like cacti and leafy ferns that they can place on their desks. Customers can order them online or from a print catalog, and Office Green will ship the plants straight to the customer's work address. Things to consider for your scope, then, might be whether or not to provide replacement plants; which customer segments will be offered the service; whether or not the online catalog is an app, a website, or both; and how to ensure customers can purchase from the online catalog, whether by phone, PC, Mac, iPhone, or Android. You might also consider the dimensions of the paper catalog and whether it needs to be in color or black and white and on what kind of paper. Now, how do you actually figure out the scope of your project? It's simple: talk to your sponsors and stakeholders, understand what their goals are, and find out what is, and this is really important, what is not included in the project.

We've covered a number of different ways to help you determine scope. Here are a few more helpful questions to add to the list. Where did the project come from? Why is it needed? What is the project expected to achieve? What does the project sponsor have in mind? Who approves the final results? Now you'll really be set. As for timing, defining project scope should happen during the initial planning stage. You want to start figuring out the scope early on so that everyone can agree to the same set of expectations. It will help mitigate the risks of big changes down the line. Although you can always adjust the scope as planning continues, if you need to. Once you understand your project scope, you want to document all the details so that anyone can refer back to it throughout the life cycle of the project. We'll talk about some best practices for that at the end of this module.

### Gathering information to define scope

In this lesson, you are learning to define project scope status and differentiate in-scope, out-of-scope, and scope creep factors that affect reaching the project goal. Let’s focus here on how to identify vital elements of a project’s scope and examine the right questions to ask in order to define it.

**Asking scope-defining questions**

Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?

Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. 

In the situation we just described, here are some questions you might ask your manager in order to get the information you need to define the scope of the project:

![mN749RQOSWie-PUUDhloDg_12b56746f80a4790b7b6857b5242e8f1_Scope-questions](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mN749RQOSWie-PUUDhloDg_12b56746f80a4790b7b6857b5242e8f1_Scope-questions.jpg?expiry=1663027200000&hmac=9H9xMU1cnxlmCNumFqu1kjXxopFV2QacToyvPXaQ5tk)

**Key takeaway**

Taking the time to ask questions and ensure that you understand the scope of the project will help reduce expenses, rework, frustration, and confusion. Make sure you understand the who, what, when, where, why, and how as it applies to the scope. If you are missing any of that information, focus your questions on those elements. The initiation phase of the project sets the foundation for the project, so ensuring that you understand the scope and expectations during this stage is essential.

### Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope

As you now know, an important part of project management is keeping an eye on your project scope and knowing which tasks are truly part of the plan and which aren't. Tasks that are included in the project and contribute to the project's overall goal are considered to be in-scope. Tasks that aren't included are called out-of-scope. It's your job as a project manager to set and maintain firm boundaries for your project so that your team can stay on track. For example, if the copywriters or designers of the Plant Pals catalog, came up with the idea to expand the type of plants being offered to top customers, you would have to point out that their suggestion is out-of-scope and would take extra time and add to your budget costs. As you progress through the project life cycle, you're going to encounter unexpected challenges or have new details or ideas brought to your attention that could impact your project's success.

Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project scope at any point after the project begins are referred to as "scope creep." Scope creep is a common problem, and it's not always easy to control. It's one that we struggle with on every single project. It can happen on any project, in any industry. Imagine you're working in a tech company and your project involves working with designers and engineers to update the language icons' design on a mobile keyboard app for a smartphone. While the team is making the update, they realize that the search icon and the voice input icon also need a design refresh. These are very small features, and while technically not in-scope, the team feels it would take minimal effort and provide lots of value. So they go ahead and make the updates. During a stakeholder review, it's pointed out that there is a keyboard in English, but no keyboards for other languages, and the suggestion is made to design additional keyboards.

At this point, the project's scope is in danger of expanding from a fairly simple icon update to a complex rollout of multiple keyboard layouts. Adding the keyboards would impact the team's timelines, causing the project to take longer to finish. It would also impact resourcing, because you would need to hire more people or existing team members would have to work overtime. And it would increase the budget, since the team did not anticipate costs for extra working hours or keyboard translations. This is just one example of scope creep. Sometimes it's subtle ("Just design one or two more icons!") or more obvious ("Hey, can you tack on designing keyboards for other languages?") By identifying scope creep and being proactive, you protect your project and your project team. To help you combat scope creep, it's good to know that there are two major sources from which it comes: external and internal. External sources of scope creep are easier to recognize. For example, if you're working on a project with one main customer, the customer might request changes, or the business environment around you might shift, or the underlying technology you're using might change.

While you can't control everything that happens, there are some useful tips to keep in mind. First, make sure the stakeholders have visibility into the project. You want them to know the details of what's going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, and how much time it'll take. Also, get clarity on the requirements and ask for constructive criticism of the initial product proposal. It's important to get this information before any contracts are signed. Be sure to set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement once the project gets started. Come to an agreement on each of your roles and responsibilities during execution and status reviews. Once you're clear on the project scope, come up with a plan for how to deal with out-of-scope requests. Agree on who can make formal change requests and how those requests will be evaluated, accepted, and performed.

And finally, be sure to get these agreements in writing. This way, you'll always have documentation to point if you, a stakeholder, or the customer have a disagreement down the line. One of the leading causes of external scope creep is not being clear on the requirements before defining the scope and getting formal approval to move forward with the project. This is where those specific and measurable goals and deliverables come into play. If the requirements aren't specific and if you haven't agreed on the project's processes, deliverables, and milestones, then you're almost guaranteed to be dealing with scope creep once the project begins. Internal sources of scope creep are trickier to spot and harder to control. This kind of creep comes from members of the project team who suggest or even insist on process or product changes or improvements. It's possible that a product developer will justify a decision on the grounds of making the product better, even though it's going to cost more, or a team lead might decide that a certain process is more efficient without realizing the impact the change in process will have on other team members tasked with different parts of the project.

What you need to make clear to your team is that any change outside of the project scope comes off the bottom line, threatens the schedule, and increases risk. There are no small impacts to project scope. Any time a team member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time spent working on that task. It's your responsibility as the project manager to maintain the limits of the project. The best defense is to know the details of your project in and out so you're always prepared with the most appropriate response to a new idea or request. Let's recap. Monitor your project's scope and protect it at all costs. Even the most minor change can mean major risk to your project's success. Coming up, I'll tell you about the triple constraint model and how you can use it to help determine how your project changes affect scope.

### Strategies for controlling scope creep

In this lesson, we have discussed the importance of defining and documenting a project’s scope and how to identify scope creep factors that can affect reaching a project’s goal. In this reading, we will focus on how to control scope creep.

**Scope management best practices**

The scope of a project can get out of control quickly—so quickly that you may not even notice it. Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success. 

Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep:

- **Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase.

- **Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.

- **Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement.

- **Provide alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.

- **Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.

- **Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements.

- **Collect costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.

**Key takeaway**

You can only avoid scope creep if everyone involved in the project understands and agrees on responsibilities, boundaries, and timelines. Avoiding scope creep also requires clear communication, expectation management, and a well-defined path to your desired outcome. Following the strategies discussed here can help you proactively manage scope creep before it creeps into your project!

### Managing changes to a project's scope

Hi, and welcome back. In this video, we're going to talk about managing project scope. Managing scope goes hand in hand with goal-setting. For example, redefining the scope can change the goal, and a revision of the goal can change the scope. The concept of project scope is important throughout the project. While your project will have its own specific goals, the overall goal for you as the project manager is to deliver the project according to the scope agreements. This includes delivering the project within the given deadline and the approved budget. You'll quickly find that this is easier said than done. As you progress through your project, you will continually need to make compromises and weigh trade-offs as new challenges and changes and factors present themselves. Any time a team member takes on an unplanned task, more is lost than just the time spent working on that task. In order to decide if a scope change is acceptable and what impact it will have, project managers usually refer to the triple constraint model.

The triple constraint model is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project: scope, time, and cost. We've talked a bit about what scope is, so let's focus now on time and cost. Time refers to the project schedule and deadlines. Cost includes the budget, and it also covers resources and the people who will work on the project. Both time and budget have to be carefully managed alongside scope. All three of these are linked; you can't change one without having an impact on the others. For example, a decrease in cost means a change in time or scope. An increase in time means a change in scope or cost, or both. Understanding how changing one impacts the other two constraints is key. It's important to consider what trade-offs you're willing to make as the project progresses. To do this successfully, you need a clear understanding of the project priorities. You have to know what is most important when it comes to scope, time, and cost. If there's a specific deadline that must be met, then you need to limit any changes to the scope that might cause the project to go past the deadline.

If the product must look or function in a certain way, then the requirements are a priority, and you could justify changes in cost or time in order to meet the scope requirements. But just because you can make a change, that doesn't mean you necessarily should make a change. And even though the limits of scope, time, and costs have been set, you can still make changes if there's a good reason to do so. Don't worry, you won't have to decide on these changes all by yourself. If there are scope decisions that need to be made, the project manager will likely need to consult with the project sponsor and stakeholders to get their approvals. Let's go through a few scenarios, so you can get familiar with weighing the value of a trade-off and understanding the impacts of any changes.

In the first scenario, a request has been made to improve the Plant Pals product features. The Director of Product at Office Green wants to use pots that indicate when the plants need to be watered. Making changes to the product is a scope change. You know that you can't change the budget, but you can extend the timeline. So you can accept the scope change requests and extend the timeline, as long as the budget doesn't increase. Here's another possible scenario. A request has been made to reduce the budget without making any changes to the scope. The final outcome of Plant Pals still needs to look and function as you all originally agreed. If you're going to reduce the budget and keep the scope, you may need to extend the timeline. Okay, here's another scenario.

There's a request to tighten up the timeline and finish early, but you can't increase the budget. In order to do this, you need to make changes to the scope, like limiting shipping options. Doing this will give your project more time, because you'll have one less shipping contract to negotiate. The end result won't be exactly what was originally agreed on, but it means getting it out earlier as requested and within budget. Let's try one more. In this last scenario, the Director of Product informs you that the project deadline must be met— it's the most important thing. In this case, your stakeholders are willing to increase the budget and make any necessary changes to the scope requirements in order to meet the deadline. In the end, it's all about prioritizing which element of the triangle matters the most in the project.

Are you getting the hang of trade-offs? Keeping in mind scope, time, and cost as you manage your project will help you navigate different conditions while still achieving your goals. Remember, change is inevitable when managing projects, and understanding this framework can set you up to plan and communicate accordingly so your project will succeed. When you understand the triple constraint model, you'll have the tools to evaluate scope changes. Understanding how changes will be evaluated, accepted, and performed is key to scope management. Don't worry if you still have questions. We'll be sure to talk more about this concept in Course 4. Up next, we'll talk more about successfully launching and landing your project.

### Torie: The importance of staying within scope

Hi, I'm Torie, and I'm an education program manager at Google. Specifically, I work on our digital literacy curriculum, called Applied Digital Skills, that helps learners of all ages learn the practical digital skills needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow. So scope is important because if you have a well-defined scope at the beginning of a project, it'll help make sure that your team members, your stakeholders are all aligned and on the same page right from the start, and you can avoid any issues down the line that may come up that you might not have been aware of. Some challenges of staying within scope could be what we like to call "scope creep," and these things can happen if, for example, you have some stakeholders that have some certain needs, desires, or requests that may actually end up changing the scope.

Scope creep is when the scope changes after you've already started the project. And this can be really challenging to manage if you don't keep an eye on it from the beginning. I was recently working on a project where we were hoping to actually reach underserved communities with our digital literacy curriculum, and the initial project scope started off focusing on middle and high school students. But at some point down the line after the project started, there were some stakeholders who actually wanted to expand the audience to adult learners. And so we had some trouble trying to figure out how we were going to manage that. Were we going to change the scope? Were we going to keep it the same? And ultimately, we decided to keep the scope the same and referenced back to our original goal in the beginning.

Because if you think about it, changing the audience would make the project goals and our strategies for reaching those audiences drastically different. So ultimately, we ended up keeping the scope and communicating that to our stakeholders. Some best practices for managing scope is just make sure you document everything in the beginning and share it with all of your stakeholders and team members, and make sure everybody's in agreement on that scope. There are times where the scope may need to change, and that's okay. But you have to be able to make sure that you can also change and potentially change your timeline, your resources, or even the budget to accommodate that scope change.

### Optional: Reviewing the Triple Constraint

![GOEdQk1-T6ehHUJNfo-n-A_0cfb775c91ec44c39b72066d3de29bf1_triple-constraint](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/GOEdQk1-T6ehHUJNfo-n-A_0cfb775c91ec44c39b72066d3de29bf1_triple-constraint.png?expiry=1663027200000&hmac=PY4wcTnd7xOZSLvNmV86q0l_QTiMoIi2K4yaOcMiJQ4)

As you’ve just learned, project managers may refer to the **triple constraint model** to manage scope and control scope creep. It can serve as a valuable tool to help you negotiate priorities and consider trade-offs.

For further reading on utilizing the triple constraint model in real-life scenarios as a project manager and how the triple constraint model has evolved over time, we recommend checking out this article: [A Project Management Triple Constraint Example & Guide.](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/triple-constraint/)

## Measuring a Project's Success

### Launching and landing a project

 At this point, you've learned a bit about setting SMART goals, along with defining and managing the scope. It may be tempting to think that you're ready to kick off this project with these two important pieces, but there is one common element that ensures you'll achieve these goals within scope. And that key element is knowing when your project is delivered and you can call it a success. Many people think the time to decide if a project is successful is when you've produced the final outcome and presented it to the client. That's getting close. Delivering the final result of your project to the client or user is what's called a project launch.

You finish building or creating a project, the tasks are completed, and the deliverables are done. You've hit your goal. The project is successful and considered complete in that sense, but does it work well? Did it achieve your desired outcome? The real deciding factor of project success is when you put the final outcome to the test. Landing is when you actually measure the success of your project using the success criteria established at the outset of the project. This is a crucial part of goal setting that is often overlooked in the initiation phase. For example, think about taking a trip on an airplane. It's not enough for the pilot to be able to get the plane off the ground. To arrive safely at your destination, they've got to know how to land. Your success has to continue beyond the point of delivering the final project. You need to be able to measure whether the project functions as intended once it's put into practice.

Let's take the example of your project Plant Pals. You've managed to launch the new service with success, the website has launched, the catalogs have been printed and delivered, orders have been received, and revenue is starting to go up. It would be easy to call this a win and move on. But what happens if the customers are unhappy once the plants are delivered? What if the plants start to wilt and discolor after a couple of weeks? Just because launching the project and getting it out the door looks like success on paper, that doesn't mean the project has managed to land. For most projects, a launch itself isn't a meaningful measure of success. It's what comes after the launch that really counts. Launches are only a means to an end, and looking beyond the launch is important to ensure the launch achieves your overall goals.

If you start off looking beyond the launch to the landing, you're more likely to get where you're trying to go. Since landing is a concept and not a finite definition, it's important to define what a successful landing looks like for a particular project. Luckily, we have a way to measure and help you ensure the success of your project. It's called success criteria, and if you can manage to follow it through the life cycle of your project, you'll ultimately have a smooth landing. The success criteria includes all the specific details of your goals and deliverables, and it can be a guide so you know whether you've accomplished what you set out to do. Success criteria will set standards for how your project will be judged. In the next video, I'll outline what you need to know about defining success criteria and communicating project success.

### Don't forget to land: Measuring Project Success

In this lesson, you are learning to distinguish the difference between a project launch and a project landing. Let’s focus here on the difference between launches and landings and how to ensure that your project will be completed successfully.

You will often hear companies celebrating the launch of a new product, service, or initiative, and it is important to remember that even when your project is out in the world, your work isn’t complete. When working on a project, the goal isn’t simply to launch it, but to land it. Landings occur once your project achieves a measure of success. As project managers, landings are what we strive for and what we celebrate. They are the ultimate reward for all of our efforts.

![nVwhvRhgSC2cIb0YYFgtlg_d23d80444634411c9d28a2841c8605f1_C2M2L3R1](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nVwhvRhgSC2cIb0YYFgtlg_d23d80444634411c9d28a2841c8605f1_C2M2L3R1.png?expiry=1663113600000&hmac=w50js0U52elewGYebaG9cid9Cr2XraGdiuQ8woYauUc)

**Launching vs. landing a project**

In project management, a project “launching” means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can’t solely base project success on when the client accepts the project, though. Your work on a project won’t be complete until you “land” it by thoroughly measuring the results. This is when the **success criteria** and the metrics you defined initially when setting SMART goals will come in handy.

Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users. Will your project increase retention? Will your project speed up a product feature? Depending on the product and situation, the answers will differ, but it is important that your team aligns and works toward the same measurable goal.

**Launch first, land later**

Let’s consider an example: imagine you are a project manager for an eco-friendly organization. Your organization asks you to create a training program for middle school students in your county to teach them about the impacts of recycling. The county's goal is to increase recycling by 20% over the next five years. You gather your team and start developing the learning content to build out this training program. It takes you and your team one year to complete the research, development, and production of this training. When you hand over the training to the school district, you are launching the project. In order to know your project actually landed at the intended goal, you need to check back in periodically over the next five years to see if the training program is on target to produce a 20% increase in recycling in the county.

**Launch and forget**

A common mistake of many project teams is to “launch and forget” the results. This happens when a project manager delivers the project to the client and the client accepts the project delivery, but the project manager doesn’t assess if the project deliverables satisfy the customer or user. In the example above, if you didn’t check back periodically over five years to assess the results, you would have only launched—but not landed—the project. Launching and landings work in tandem to ensure true success. 

A project landing shouldn’t create more hurdles. If done correctly, a landing creates greater alignment within the teams on the end results you all desire, and it gives everybody on the team better visibility on how to achieve success.

**Key takeaway**

Launching your project to the client can be a very big moment for you. You handed over the project to your client and now you can take a step back and breathe. But make sure you land your project, as well. Look over your notes, talk with your team, meet with the client, and remember to return to your intended deliverables and metrics to help you measure success.

### Defining success criteria

We've learned about the differences between launching and landing, and we've also learned about the differences between delivering your project and finding out if the outcome performs as expected. But how exactly do you know that your project is a success? How do you know if you've actually landed? At the beginning of the project, you defined goals and deliverables that are measurable—meaning that you can determine if they were met. Similarly, you need to define success criteria that can also be measured so you'll know whether they were met. The success criteria will tell you whether or not the project as a whole was successful.

They are the specific details of your goals and deliverables that tell you whether you've accomplished what you set out to do. They are the standards by which the project will be judged once it's been delivered to stakeholders and customers. Defining success criteria also clarifies for your team what they're trying to accomplish beyond just launching something to users. Is it to increase customer satisfaction with the service so they can continue to purchase more products? Enhance an existing feature to retain customers? Depending on the project, the answers will be different. But, it's important that a team is aligned and working towards a shared goal. Sometimes forcing the conversation and clarifying what the end result looks like can bring to light questions and areas of disagreement.

There isn't a set process for determining success criteria, but I'll break down a couple of key points to consider. Remember the measurable part of your SMART goals? One of the questions to ask when making your goals measurable is: How will I know when it is accomplished? The same question applies to your project: How will you know when it's done? Only in this case, you want to ask: How will I know when it's successfully accomplished? You can measure to determine your project success in a similar way to measuring a goal. So go through your project goals and deliverables, review the scope, and identify the measurable aspects of your project. These are going to be any of the metrics used in the goals and deliverables, along with your budget and schedule details. Another thing you'll need to do is get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations.

This is key! There are lots of people involved with any project, and that means lots of ideas about what success looks like to each person. You'll want to ask questions, such as: Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? What criteria will be measured to determine success? What's the success of this project based on? Once you've collected clarifying information, document and share all of it so that you, your team, and your stakeholders can refer to it later. Let's try creating success criteria with the Office Green project. For example, the goal is to increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year. One of the deliverables is a website with a gallery of the different plant selections that are offered. It's not enough just to make a list of criteria; you need a process for measuring success from start to finish throughout the entire project life cycle.

This way, you can make adjustments and ensure success by the time you're ready to land. There are many metrics you can use, and for some products, it will make sense to use more than one. The metrics you choose should be as closely aligned to your project's goal as possible. For example, "happiness metrics" measure user attitudes and satisfaction, or perceived ease of use, and you can measure these through surveys. For the Plant Pals project, we may consider a customer satisfaction rate of 85% within the first three months of launching as a way to measure success. You can also consider customer adoption and engagement metrics, along with more business-oriented metrics that track things like sales and growth. Adoption refers to how the customer uses and adopts a product or service without any issues. Engagement refers to how often or meaningful customer interaction and participation is over time.

Adoption metrics might include launching a new product to a group of users and having a high amount of them use or adopt it. Engagement metrics might include increasing the daily usage of a design feature or increasing orders and customer interactions. Using the Office Green example, tracking how many customers initially sign up for and use to Plant Pals service is an adoption metric. Tracking how many customers renew their Plant Pals service, post about it, or share feedback are engagement metrics.

Once you've defined the metrics that you'll be measuring, think about how you track these metrics. Evaluate which tools can help you collect the data you need to ensure you're staying on track. For example, if you're measuring business metrics like revenue, consider tracking that in a spreadsheet or dashboard, where you can easily spot gaps and trends. If you're measuring customer satisfaction, you can think of a way to incentivize customers to participate in regular email surveys and create a system to measure their responses when they participate. You can also utilize your project management tools to check on efficiency metrics, like what percent of tasks are completed or whether the project is progressing alongside the planned timelines.

It's smart to measure success with your team as a project or product is in progress. For example, you can hold a project review once a month, have team members complete task checklists by certain deadlines, or hold live feedback sessions with your users or customers. There are many different ways to measure success. The key is to pick the methods that work best for your success criteria. It's a good idea that, along with each success criteria on your list, to also include the methods for how success will be measured, how often it's measured, and who's responsible for measuring it. Share your success criteria document with your stakeholders and ask if they agree with how the project's success will be determined. It's also a good idea to have the appropriate stakeholders sign off on the success criteria.

This way, everyone will be clear on who is responsible for which tasks, and you'll all thoroughly understand what the path to success entails. Keep this documentation visible throughout the duration of the project and clearly communicate it with your team every step of the way. They're the ones who will be attempting to meet all the different requirements, so don't keep them in the dark about what they're supposed to do or how they're supposed to do it. If done correctly, defining your success criteria should create greater alignment within the team and give everybody better visibility into how to achieve success. Clarity around success metrics also helps teams prioritize which efforts are most impactful to their users.

Defining project success is a complex but crucial part of project management. With more and more practice, this process will come more naturally to you in the planning stages and throughout your project. We'll continue exploring and talking more about these concepts throughout the course. Nice job! You're almost done with Module 2. I'll see you in a bit to review what we've covered.

### Tracking and communicating success criteria

![uLvzXHcUTYu781x3FB2Luw_2133ab7f20494358a6ddbe883fdff9f1_success-criteria](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uLvzXHcUTYu781x3FB2Luw_2133ab7f20494358a6ddbe883fdff9f1_success-criteria.png?expiry=1663286400000&hmac=MHDXotvFSQI9iA0KTCu9K0Y89Dm1ZuADS08awDlrfc0)

We recently covered the topic about launching and landing projects, and now we will turn our focus to ensuring that our landings are successful.

Recall that SMART goals are **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ttainable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound and help keep a project on track for success.

We can also determine the success of a project by the quality of the product, the ability to fulfill the needs of your customers, and the need to meet the expectations of your stakeholders. For this reading, we will discuss these particular success criteria, the metrics we use to track them, and how and why we communicate our findings.

**Product quality**

The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. The product attributes that are necessary for the product’s success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. The extent that a product is complete will contribute to the product’s success. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of product requirements to ensure that you do not miss anything. For example, if the project produces word processing software, you need basic features like text entry, formatting, saving, and printing. Since you require each feature to have a functional word processor by today’s standards, you include these features on your checklist.

To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist:

- Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements

- Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects

- Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project

**What is important to the customers or stakeholders**

We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer additional expectations for features and objectives. In the word processor example, a stakeholder may want to add an additional functionality to easily create tables in a document with text. Additionally, a strategic goal of the organization could be to create word processor software with more collaborative ability than the word processors currently on the market. Each component is necessary in order to meet customer and stakeholder expectations. Think about what needs the project satisfies for your stakeholders or customers. These strategic goals tie back to the business case and the reason you initiated the project in the first place. Often, you can measure the fulfillment of strategic goals via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:

- Evaluating user engagement with the product

- Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys

- Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

**Document, align, and communicate success**

Understanding where we are and where we are going helps the project team determine if they are on track. As you learned in the video on this topic, you need to get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations. There are many people involved with any project, and success will look different for each of them. You want to ask questions, such as: Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? What criteria will be measured to determine success? What is the success of this project based on? It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria. This becomes a mutual agreement on how all parties define the success of the project.

**Key takeaway**

Remember, all projects encounter change. All parties must have continuous access and alignment to the success criteria agreed upon to avoid scope creep (uncontrolled change of the project’s scope) or failed expectations at the end of the project. It’s important to document success criteria upfront and continue to report on it throughout the project.

### Using OKRs to evaluate progress

In this lesson, you are learning to define a project’s **success criteria,** the measurable attributes project managers use to determine whether or not a project was successful as a whole. This reading will focus on using **OKRs** to evaluate a project’s progress.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**

You have learned that OKRs—Objectives and Key Results--combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. Setting OKRs is a technique that can help project teams define, communicate, and measure shared success criteria.

![jWmtk9_MT8KprZPfzG_CCA_26e936656ba24f7a96b5de34e4f8ccfa_C2M2L3R3](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jWmtk9_MT8KprZPfzG_CCA_26e936656ba24f7a96b5de34e4f8ccfa_C2M2L3R3.png?expiry=1663372800000&hmac=6vnTPs1h1lkCPjJCmoYcZFxldPzHuvBBuYRAg3Tohhs)

![UIeFZ5w6RiuHhWecOuYrCA_d03717fb11444bf581b815d21e2b45f1_OKRs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/UIeFZ5w6RiuHhWecOuYrCA_d03717fb11444bf581b815d21e2b45f1_OKRs.png?expiry=1663372800000&hmac=aV0nvg8KFkyWzOQXyMrHBvV5rBRo3VrSZt21xGmCs-o)

**Communicating and tracking OKRs**

Conducting regular check-ins and actively tracking progress with your team can help ensure that objectives are being met and that any issues are resolved as soon as possible.

**Share your OKRs with your team.** Once you’ve created OKRs for your project, it’s important to communicate them to your team so that everyone knows how to focus and align their efforts. You can do this by sharing a digital document, presenting them in a meeting, or adding them to an internal website. OKRs can help your project team stick to its goals, monitor which are falling short, and be continuously motivated to meet project objectives.

**Assign owners.** Assign an owner to every key result so that everybody knows who’s responsible for what. This helps add clarity and increases accountability.

**Measuring progress**

Measuring your OKRs is an important part of tracking and sharing your progress. One shortcut to determining the status of a project is to score or grade your OKRs. While scores or grades don’t provide a complete assessment of a project’s success, they’re helpful tools for determining how close you came to achieving your objectives. You can then share your OKR scores with project stakeholders and team members as part of your overall project updates.

**Determine how you will score your OKRs.** OKRs can be scored in different ways. You can score based on a percentage of the objective completed, the completion of certain milestones, or a scale of 1 to 10, for example. You can also use a “traffic light” scoring approach, where red means you didn’t make any progress, yellow means you made some progress, and green means you completed your objective.

The simplest approach to scoring OKRs is the “yes/no” method, with “yes” meaning you achieved your objective and “no” meaning you didn’t. Using this approach, a key result such as “Launch a new widget marketing campaign” might be graded a 1 or 0 depending on whether it was launched (1) or not (0). 

A more advanced scoring approach is to grade your key results on a scale. With this method, if a key result was to “Launch six new features” and only three new features were launched, the OKR might be graded 0.5. Generally, if the KR helped you achieve the objective, your OKR should receive a higher score; if it didn't, your OKR should receive a lower score. 

At Google, OKRs are usually graded on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning the objective was fully achieved. Each individual key result is graded and then the grades are averaged to determine the score for that OKR.

**Set your scoring expectations.** With Google’s 0.0–1.0 scale, the expectation is to set ambitious OKRs and aim to achieve an average of at least 0.6 to 0.7 across all OKRs. For OKRs graded according to percentage achieved, the sweet spot is somewhere in the 60–70% range. Scoring lower may mean the team is not achieving what it could be. Scoring higher may mean the aspirational goals are not being set high enough.

**Schedule checkpoints.** It’s important to regularly communicate the status of project OKRs with your team and senior managers. For example, it can be helpful to have monthly check-ins on the progress of OKRs to give both individuals and your team a sense of where they are. Typically, at the end of the quarter, you’ll grade each of your OKRs to evaluate how well the team did to achieve its goals.

**Key takeaway**

OKRs can help you define and measure your project’s success criteria. In order for OKRs to be used to effectively meet your project’s success criteria, it’s important to share them with your team, assign owners to each key result to ensure accountability, measure your OKRs’ progress by scoring them, and track your OKRs’ progress by scheduling regular check-ins with your team.

### Wrap-up

You're doing great! You've completed this module and have set yourself up for success. Way to go! Defining goals and managing scope and ensuring a successful landing might seem tricky to master at first, but the SMART method and the triple constraint triangle, tools, and methods for measuring success criteria and clear communication will help you every step of the way.

In the next module, we will talk about the roles and responsibilities that come along with each project so that everyone knows how they contribute to reaching the project's goals.

## WEEK 3 - Module 2

## Exploring project team roles and responsibilities

### Introduction: Working effectively with stakeholders

Welcome back. In this module, we'll learn all about stakeholders and their importance to a project. In the last set of videos, you learned the ins and outs of project scope. While exploring how a project can be in-scope or out-of-scope, you learned about setting SMART goals. We also discussed launching a project (getting it started) versus landing a project (whether or not it was successful). And there are a lot more exciting topics to come! In this module you'll learn more about stakeholders. Remember that stakeholders play a pivotal role. They are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success.

You'll see that each person involved has a set role and set responsibilities to help bring the project to a landing. Those roles include project sponsors, customers, team members, and of course, you, the project manager. You will also find out about things like stakeholder mapping and analysis and RACI charts. These are tools that help clarify roles and responsibilities and prevent confusion on who takes ownership of which tasks. Throughout this module, you'll have plenty of hands-on activities, discussion prompts, and readings to really help you master how to start a project. As we go through each new skill, imagine checking off a to-do list. There's almost nothing more satisfying than crossing off a to-do!

### Accessibility for project managers

Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Holly and I will be your accessibility instructor for this course. Accessibility should be incorporated into every role at a company, whether a product designer, communicator, developer or yes, project manager. In my role of accessibility education program manager at Google, I help ensure all Googlers are educated on accessibility, from building accessible products for the entire world, to communicating accessibility with you throughout this course. I'm deaf myself, so I am able to share my experiences as a person with a disability too and help others understand that having a disability isn't a barrier in itself.

It's the world around us that we must strive to make it accessible for everyone. Accessibility can be defined in a number of different ways. To me, it means actively removing any barriers that might prevent persons with disabilities from being able to access technology, information, or experiences, and leveling in the playing field so everyone has an equal chance of enjoying life and being successful. A disability is often defined as a physical or mental condition that substantially limits a major life activity, such as walking, talking, seeing, hearing, or learning. Over one billion people in the world have a disability, 1 billion. That's more than the population of the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico, and Brazil combined.

Disability is diverse and intersectional. Someone can be born with a condition or acquire it later in life. Disability can affect us all in some way, whether directly or indirectly, and at any time, from permanent, like deafness, to temporary, like a broken leg, to situational, like trying to operate a TV remote control in the dark. When you create solutions for persons with disabilities, you are not only serving the critical audience of people with permanent disabilities, you are also unlocking secondary benefits for everyone who may move in and out of disability over time. As you progress through this course, it's also important to keep in mind your fellow classmates.

Setting the expectation that you'll be interacting with others that learn and work differently is a key strength of working with accessibility in mind. Asking others what they need from you to learn and communicate and also sharing what you need if you have a disability yourself is important to working well together as a team. In project management, you, yourself, people on your project team, or people highly invested in your project may have a disability, whether visible or invisible. As a project manager, you are responsible for making sure a group of people can come together to achieve a common goal using shared tools and systems. In order to be successful, you need to make sure the infrastructure and culture you set up works for everyone.

Knowing this is a key element of project management. I'll teach you how to make your work and content accessible. I'll also help you become a better project manager by considering accessibility in your future projects. I'll offer tips and best practices throughout the program, starting with this one. Did you know that many technologies that we all enjoy started out as an accessibility feature? Think about the Google Assistant, which allows you to control your home with your voice, or close captioning, which makes it possible to watch the TV above a crowded, noisy bar. By considering accessibility, you can impact everyone's lives for the better. I'm excited to share more with you throughout the program where you'll learn more about project management and prepare for a career in this field. See you later.

### Choosing a project team

In this video, I'll take you through the process of choosing roles and responsibilities of all the people on your project team. In order to decide who does what on a project, we have to consider and outline our needs. Choosing the right people for a team is a big task, and one every project manager should take seriously. After all, these are the people who do the work on the project, so we want to make sure we have the right people lined up. When identifying people resources, we need to carefully consider the project needs and use that info to guide our decision-making. First, a project manager will make a list of roles that they'll need on their team to complete each task. In the same way that a project manager is accountable for the overall initiation, planning, execution, and completion of a project, the person in each role is accountable for specific tasks within the project life cycle.

For example, a home construction project team might include roles on their lists like an architect, a site manager, and multiple construction workers. Once the tasks are clearly laid out, the project manager decides how many people they'll need on their team. This can vary greatly depending on the project size. For small projects, a team may only need three or four people to complete the deliverables on time, and for larger projects, a team might include dozens. At Google, we sometimes have hundreds of Googlers working on the same project. Getting the team size right is important for a bunch of reasons. For example, when there's a lot of people on a project, communication sometimes becomes difficult. That makes it more likely for someone to miss important details. But if your team is too small, there might not be enough people to finish all the tasks. Once you know how many people you need on your team, you have to think about who does what.

To decide on the right person for each role, a project manager needs to think carefully about skills. Makes sense, right? If you're managing the construction of a house, you want to note that the construction workers who are building the frame or installing the drywall have the skills needed to do it properly. It's on the project manager to ensure that everyone on the team has the right skills to do the job, but it's also important to remember that skills can be taught. If someone doesn't have a certain skill initially, they might still be a great fit for the team. Maybe this person brings a positive attitude and attention to detail— perfectly good reasons to have them on your team. Just keep in mind that if a teammate doesn't have the necessary skills, it's important that they are trained in time so as not to cause project delays. When choosing teammates, a project manager also has to factor in each person's availability and whether they'll feel motivated to complete their assigned tasks.

For example, you might know a fantastic site manager who would make a great asset to the team, but if they're already staffed on another big project, they might not have the time to commit to yours. Or even if they do have the time, they may not feel like this project will give them the visibility they need for a promotion. Motivation is a key ingredient to great work. It's a good idea to pick people who are excited to get involved, but of course, we don't always get to choose our resources. Sometimes another manager or team lead might just assign people to roles. When this happens, it's the project manager's challenge to deliver the best work with what we're given. Let's check in on our project at Office Green, where we're rolling out a new service. As a project manager, it's up to you to decide who you need on your team. You have to ask yourself questions on things like staff experience, availability, the workspace, team member workload on other projects, and more.

For example, who on the team has office landscaping experience? Who's local to the city where the launch will happen? Who can be fully dedicated to this project for the next eight weeks? There's no exact formula for putting together the right team, which makes it a little tricky. Every situation is different and calls for a different set of skills, experience, and perspectives. It can be helpful to look deeper into each task on the project. Always ask yourself these key questions: how many people do I need on my team each step of the way? Which team members do I need and when? Are those experts already busy on other projects? Who makes the final decisions on project resources? So there's a lot to think about when putting together your dream team. Up next, we'll learn more about all the different roles on a project. See you there!

### Review: The building blocks of a project dream team

In the previous video, we explored some considerations for choosing your project team and assigning their roles and responsibilities. Let’s recap what you learned and expand upon what to think about when building your project team.

![uALjjCakT0qC44wmpO9K7Q_62e8444bd9b94c359f627ebaf6edecbb_Screen-Shot-2021-04-05-at-11.44.03-AM](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/uALjjCakT0qC44wmpO9K7Q_62e8444bd9b94c359f627ebaf6edecbb_Screen-Shot-2021-04-05-at-11.44.03-AM.png?expiry=1663459200000&hmac=C6KyPWF4f31F40tloRaMd0_1fKyEsigLg4wTvE0Tjq0)

**Too big, too small, or just right?**

Once you lay the foundation for your project by outlining your goals and expectations, it is time to build your dream team! Though before we can build our dream team, we need to figure out how many people we need. This number will largely depend on the size of the project itself. Complex projects with large divisions of work will usually require larger project teams. Simple projects with straightforward expectations may only require a few people on the project team. As a project manager, it is your job to help find the right balance based on what is needed.

**The right skills and abilities to fill the role**

Multiple roles exist in every project. On smaller teams, multiple roles may be filled by one person. To meet the needs of more specialized projects, project managers might require people who have the necessary technical skills. Technical skills are the skills specific to the task that needs to be performed. For example, on the Office Green project, necessary technical skills may include indoor landscaping design for the layout of the plants within the offices and floral design of plant arranging.  

Technical skills are highly valued, but they are not the only skills that are important for high functioning teams. Interpersonal skills, also known as people skills or soft skills, such as patience and conflict mediation, can help team members. This allows the team to blend their technical expertise with collaborative skills in order to get the job done. When a team applies their interpersonal skills, they can minimize team-related issues.

**Problem-solving skills** are a must for all team members, especially when it comes to large, complex projects. As a project manager, you will not be able to solve every problem for your team. At some point, they will need to use their own judgment to problem-solve and get the work done.

An underrated skill set for project team members are **leadership skills**. Strong leadership skills help team members navigate organizational boundaries and effectively communicate with stakeholders to generate buy-in.

**Who is available?**

In projects, the availability of your team is always a big concern. This is especially true in Matrix organizations, where team members have multiple bosses. It is not uncommon to pull a team member onto another project before your project is complete. In a perfect world, you only pick those who can stay on the project for its entire life cycle. You may find that you don’t get to pick certain members of your team at all, which is called a pre-assignment. In these cases, the sponsor assigns team members to your project.

Keep in mind that you need to value diversity early on when building your team. On diverse teams, everyone is able to use their unique professional and personal experiences to contribute to a more successful project. Diversity is best leveraged when it is acknowledged and highlighted as an asset. Many people avoid discussing their differences, but if you encourage those conversations, you will find a richer understanding and greater creativity that comes from people working together across identity differences. To do this effectively, it is important to dedicate time early on in the team building process to develop trust between team members. Team members who understand one another are more likely to trust each other and feel safe sharing different points of view or offer a competing perspective. This will also allow them to more easily offer constructive feedback or be supportive if the team dynamics face challenges at any point.

**What motivates them?**

Be sure to take note of the motivation level of your team members and the impact it may have on your project. Just because a person is pre-assigned to a project, doesn’t necessarily mean they have low interest in it, but a person who proactively volunteered for it may have additional motivation to do the work.

As a project manager, it is your responsibility to engage your team and keep them motivated. This is where your influence as a leader is required to keep the team engaged and ready to overcome any obstacles that may appear. Engaging in a respectful manner and maintaining a positive outlook with your team during times of adversity are simple ways to keep your team motivated.

**Key takeaway**

In summary, team size, skills, availability, and motivation are the building blocks to creating your very own dream team. Always keep in mind that a project manager does not just select dream teams, they create dream teams through collaboration under great leadership. This is the leadership that you will provide as a project manager.

### Defining project roles

As we mentioned in the last video, when you're managing a project to meet certain goals, having the right team around you is a must. Why is it so important? It's because there could be so many moving parts on a project. That means you really need to have confidence and trust that the people around you have the skills and motivation to do the work well.

To feel confident in your team, you need to know each person's role from the start. Clearly laying out the responsibilities for each role helps everyone know what project tasks they're accountable for. Odds are, you can't complete this project on your own, even if you're the best project manager of all time, which we know you will be. Before we jump into the specific roles on a project, we want to call out that some roles aren't fixed. Sometimes team members need to adapt and take on more than one role at a time. This usually happens if the company is small or resources are limited. For example, at a small firm, you might be the project manager, designer, and marketer. Whether they're fixed or not, we always have these project roles.

Project sponsors, team members, customers or users, stakeholders, and of course, the project manager. Let's learn more about each of them. A project sponsor is the person who is accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers the agreed upon value to the business. They play a vital leadership role throughout the process. Sometimes they fund the project. The sponsor will probably communicate directly with managers and key stakeholders. Team members are the heart of the operation. They're the people doing the day to day work and making the project happen. The customers are the people who will get some sort of value from a successfully landed project. Since the project aims to deliver something useful to the customers, the customer's needs usually define the project's requirements. You can think of them as the buyers of the project.

In some situations, we have both customers and users for a project, and we need to differentiate between the two. Simply put, users are the people that ultimately use the product that your project will produce. To make the distinction nice and clear for you, think of it this way: a software company has created a type of software that allows teams to communicate with each other in an instant message application. The software is purchased by corporation ABC; they are the customer. But the users are everyone within corporation ABC that will be using the instant message application every day. Stakeholders are anyone involved in the project; those who have a vested interest in the project's success. Primary stakeholders are people who expect to benefit directly from the project's completion, while secondary stakeholders play an intermediary role and are indirectly impacted by the project.

Secondary stakeholders may be contractors or members of a partner organization, but both primary and secondary stakeholders help project managers define project goals and outcomes. And finally, we can't forget the project manager: the person who plans, organizes and oversees the whole project. That's you. Let's now plug these roles into our Office Green project. Recall that Office Green is a commercial plant company that does interior landscaping and plant design for offices and other commercial businesses.

We're launching our new plant service, so if you recall our SMART goal— which must be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound— is to roll out a new service to provide office plants to top clients by the end of the year. There's a lot to do when launching a new service. Plants need to be ordered and delivered every few days. New clients will need to be familiarized with Office Green and its procedures. And there will be ongoing updates to the website and app. For Office Green's launch, our project sponsor is the Director of Product. They approve the project's budget and ensure that everything stays aligned to the vision, which in this case, is that inexpensive and easy-to-maintain live plants are provided in order to improve the employees' work environments.

The team's made up of people from across departments, and they're all working together to support the project. For example, the marketing department has assigned some people to the team because they'll need to tell customers about this new service. On this project, the landscape designer is also the website designer. This is an example of where a team member plays more than one role. And you? You're the project manager. You're the one managing the information, people, and schedule to carry this project to a successful landing. Our customers for this project are buyers at offices who might be interested in Office Green's services, such as the office managers or procurement teams. However, the users are the employees who work at the offices because they're the ones who enjoy the plants.

And finally, all of these people are project stakeholders. Secondary stakeholders won't play active roles throughout all phases of the project but still need to be informed as they are a component of what the project needs to succeed. For example, these include Office Green's investors, who are helping to fund the new service launch, and the Office Green receptionist, who will answer a lot of customer questions about the new service once it's launched. So, now that we know why it's so important to decide on these roles early on and how these roles work within a project, let's put them into action!

### Essential project roles

In this lesson, you are learning to define project roles and responsibilities. Let’s now build on what you have learned about building your project team and focus on how to further identify the core roles and responsibilities that are critical to any project.

**The project manager**

Although all team members are responsible for their individual parts of the project, the project manager is responsible for the overall success of the team, and ultimately, the project as a whole. A project manager understands that paying close attention to team dynamics is essential to successfully completing a project, and they use team-building techniques, motivation, influencing, decision-making, and coaching skills, to keep their teams strong. 

Project managers integrate all project work by developing the project management plan, directing the work, documenting reports, controlling change, and monitoring quality. 

In addition, project managers are responsible for balancing the scope, schedule, and cost of a project by managing engagement with stakeholders. When managing engagement with stakeholders, project managers rely on strong communication skills, political and cultural awareness, negotiation, trust-building, and conflict management skills.

**Stakeholders**

Have you ever heard the phrase “the stakes are high"? When we talk about “stakes,” we are referring to the important parts of a business, situation, or project that might be at risk if something goes wrong. To hold stake in a business, situation, or project means you are invested in its success. There will often be several parties that will hold stake in the outcome of a project. Each group’s level of investment will differ based on how the outcome of the project may impact them. Stakeholders are often divided into two groups: **primary stakeholders**, also known as key stakeholders, and **secondary stakeholders**. A primary stakeholder is directly affected by the outcome of the project, while a secondary stakeholder is indirectly affected by the outcome of the project. 

Primary stakeholders usually include team members, senior leaders, and customers. For example, imagine that you are a project manager for a construction company that is commissioned to build out a new event space for a local catering company. On this project, the owners of the catering company would be primary stakeholders since they are paying for the project.

Another primary stakeholder could be the CEO of your construction company. If the CEO likes to be directly involved with projects for local businesses like the catering company, that would make them a primary stakeholder. 

An example of a secondary stakeholder might be the project’s point of contact in legal. While the project outcome might not affect them directly, the project itself would impact their work when they process the contract. Each project will have a different set of stakeholders, which is why it’s important for the project manager to know who they are, what they need, and how to communicate with them.

**Project team members**

Every successful team needs strong leadership and membership, and project management is no exception! Project team members are also considered primary stakeholders, since they play a crucial role in getting the job done. Your team members will vary depending on the type, complexity, and size of the project. It’s important to consider these variables as you select your project team and begin to work with them. Remember that choosing teammates with the right technical skills and interpersonal skills will be valuable as you work to meet your project goals. If you are not able to select your project team, be sure to champion diversity and build trust to create harmony within the team.

**Sponsor**

The **project sponsor** is another primary stakeholder. A sponsor initiates the project and is responsible for presenting a business case for its existence, signing the project charter, and releasing resources to the project manager. The sponsor is very important to the project, so it’s critical to communicate with them frequently throughout all project phases. In our construction company example, the CEO could also be the project sponsor.

**Key takeaway**

Although the roles involved in each project will vary, all projects will include a project manager and primary stakeholders who are directly impacted by the project’s outcome, such as team members, senior leaders, the customer, and the project sponsor. Secondary stakeholders, whose work less directly impacts the project, may also play a role. Keep these roles in mind as we take a closer look at the importance of stakeholders.

### John: The importance of a project team

My name is John Fyle, and I'm a technical program manager for Google in the Chicago office. I've worked a couple different companies. I've worked at startups, I've worked at grocery companies, and I've worked at Google. And what I've found is at some companies, what you find is that there's engineers that come in and what they're looking for is direction. They want to be told what to do; they want to be handed the task and just execute on it. At Google, people are really invested in their product. We call Google a bottom-up kind of culture. You know, a lot of companies, you have this directive from the top saying "This is what we're gonna do," but at Google, people are so passionate about the industry and what they're working on, that the ideas really come up and bubble up from the bottom. What I always tell folks is that the technical and hard skills of program management, you can pick up in a book.

You can learn about Agile, and you can learn about Extreme Programming. You can learn about all these things: planning, retrospectives, all these great terms and tools and stuff like that. At the end of the day, that's all they are, though. They're just a tool, and you can't use a hammer for a screw. It's the same thing with program management; you can't use the same tools for every project. You have to learn what's going on in a given team, in a given project, and a given group of people. And so at the end of the day, really the challenge is understanding the dynamics of the people that you work with. I like to say that the key about program management is people and contexts. You have to understand the people that you're working with, you have to understand the context, and only then can you apply the skills that you learned.

You won't always have the opportunity to pick and choose what people you want to work on a project, and that's okay, because you can just use those tools that you've gained in the past to understand the backgrounds and the style and the personalities of the people that you're working with. The most important part about program management is understanding the personalities of the people you work with so that you can tailor your approach to make sure that you're working effectively with them. Think about it this way. You might be working with an introverted person. That person needs different types of attention that an extroverted person. An extroverted person wants to talk about their ideas and their product plans in a meeting. An introverted person, you might want to get their feedback offline or to have an async kind of forum opportunity for them to voice their opinion.

It's really not going to be cut and dry every time you work on a project, and that's why it's really, really important that you're flexible in your approach. You want to have people that are challenging the choices that we make. But at the end of the day, we all need to agree on a common goal and a common vision so that we can move forward. We don't want distractions because that's the thing that the one thing that can slow things down. At the end of the day, technical problems aren't that hard. People problems are really hard. And making sure that your team is sold and bought in on a vision and the project is super, super important. It's your goal and your job role as a program manager to motivate the team and make sure that everyone's on the same page.

## Evaluating stakeholders

### Completing a stakeholder analysis

We just saw how important stakeholders are to the project and how both primary and secondary stakeholders help project managers define project goals and outcomes. As a quick refresher, primary stakeholders are people who will benefit directly from the project's success, while secondary stakeholders are indirectly impacted by the project's success. Having all these different people involved on a project can get confusing, and that's where a stakeholder analysis comes in handy. This is a visual representation of all the stakeholders. It helps you avoid surprises, build necessary partnerships, and ensure you're involving the right people at the right time. When done well, your stakeholder analysis helps you see all the opportunities for success and the potential risks, it illustrates which stakeholders are taking on which responsibilities, and it can help you include the right people in important conversations, which is key to getting the support you need throughout the project.

There are three key steps to kicking off a stakeholder analysis. First, make a list of all the stakeholders that the project impacts. Then determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder. And finally, assess their ability to participate, and find ways to involve them. In the second step, we talk about influence and interests. What do those terms mean here? Influence measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much the stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome. In our Office Green example, the Director of Product, who first initiated the project and oversees new products and services, has a huge amount of influence, while the vendor providing the greenery has less influence. Interest is pretty much what it sounds like: How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes? For example, Office Green's human resources department may not have as much interest in the product launch as a sales department does.

The power grid is a super useful two-by-two grid used for conducting a stakeholder analysis. We use the power grid to assign each stakeholder's level of importance to the project, measuring their interest and influence. The position of the stakeholder on the grid usually determines their active role in the project. The higher the interest and influence, the more important the stakeholder is to the project's success. Without their support, it's unlikely that the project will successfully land. These people are our key stakeholders. Now that you have a better idea of each stakeholder's position on the team, you can plan how to best manage everyone. There are four different techniques you can use for managing stakeholders. The first group of stakeholders are the key players, or key stakeholders. You'll find these people in the top right corner of the grid. To best manage key stakeholders, you'll want to closely partner with them to reach the desired outcomes. Of course, not everyone's a key stakeholder, but each role, even the non-key stakeholder, gets a spot on the grid.

You'll find stakeholders with higher influence but lower interest in the top left corner of the grid. To manage these stakeholders, you'll want to consult with them and meet their needs. Their opinions and input are important to the project. The Director of Product has high influence, but may not be vested into day-to-day activities, and therefore will have a lower interest. Stakeholders with lower influence but high interest are in the right bottom corner of the grid. For these stakeholders, you'll want to show consideration for them by keeping them up-to-date on the project. It's unlikely they'll need a say in what's going on, but keeping them informed is important. For example, the customer success team may have lower influence but high interest since they'll work directly with clients on the new product. Last up, we have stakeholders with low influence and low interest. You'll find these in the bottom left corner. They're the least important of the stakeholders, but this doesn't mean that they don't matter.

It might just be that for this particular project, they aren't as integral. So for this project, you mainly want to monitor them, keeping them in the know. Creating a grid like this is an effective way to track who should be communicated with and when. This grid here is an example of how that might play out, depending on the project and the stakeholders. You may also want to create a steering committee made up of a high influence and high interest stakeholders. These people will be the most senior decision-making body on any project. They have the authority to make changes to budget and approve updates to timeline or scope. The project manager isn't a member of the committee, but they're responsible for bringing the right project information to the steering committee so that decisions can be quickly made. How you engage your stakeholders from this point on depends on your particular situation.

There are different ways to involve each stakeholder, and you have to be strategic to get helpful and relevant input from the right people at the right time. You'll want to meet with some stakeholders every single day, and others you'll just send periodic updates to. Stakeholder buy-in is the process of involving these people in decision-making to hopefully reach a broader consensus on the organization's future. To get stakeholders to buy in on the project, you'll have to pay particular attention to your high-impact stakeholders and make sure they feel looped in. You'll want to explain to them how the project will help them achieve their goals, and you want to have their support later on if any issues come up. Here are some important things to keep in mind when communicating with stakeholders: If you have one main stakeholder, that stakeholder is likely to be highly influential and needs constant communication.

But if you're on a larger project with numerous stakeholders, they won't be quite as involved in the day-to-day tasks. For stakeholders who need time to make decisions about the project, over-communicate early on. For example, hold frequent meetings and send daily end-of-day progress emails. This way, they have enough time to weigh the options and make decisions. Think about the level of project details each stakeholder needs. You don't want to spend time diving deep with stakeholders that just need a project summary. For example, the facilities team that delivers the product doesn't need daily updates on vendor pricing or website issues. On the flip side, do spend time updating key members that need frequent updates. The sales team will need to know pricing and availability changes, so a weekly check-in might make sense here. Great work. You just completed your own stakeholder analysis. Up next, we'll check out another tool, RACI charting. See you there.

### Prioritizing stakeholders and generating their buy-in

In this lesson, you are learning to complete a stakeholder analysis and explain its significance. Let’s focus here on how to prioritize the various types of stakeholders that can exist on a project, generate stakeholder buy-in, and manage their expectations.

**Conducting a stakeholder analysis**

**Stakeholders** are an essential part of any project. A project manager’s ability to balance stakeholder requirements, get their buy-in, and understand when and how to involve them is key to successfully fulfilling a project.  

It is key to keep stakeholders organized in order to understand when and how to involve them at the right time. In an earlier video, we introduced the **stakeholder analysis**, a useful tool that project managers use to understand stakeholders’ needs and help minimize hiccups during your project life cycle. 

Let’s review the key steps in the stakeholder analysis:

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts. When generating this list, ask yourself: Who is invested in the project? Who is impacted by this project? Who contributes to this project?

2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder—this step helps you determine who your key stakeholders are. The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project.

3. Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them. Various types of projects will yield various types of stakeholders—some will be **active stakeholders** with more opinions and touch points and others will be **passive stakeholders,** preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day. That said, just because a stakeholder does not participate as often as others does not mean they are not important. There are lots of factors that will play a role in determining a stakeholder’s ability to participate in a project, like physical distance from the project and their existing workload.

**Pro tip:** You might want to form a **steering committee** during some projects. A steering committee is a collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project. A steering committee can influence multiple departments within the organization, which means that they have the potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager.

**Visualizing your analysis**

A **power grid** shows stakeholder interest in the project versus their influence over the project. This four-quadrant tool helps project managers evaluate how to manage their stakeholders. It is used to determine the appropriate level of engagement required by the project team needed to gain the stakeholders’ trust and buy-in.

![QqyQX0yCRPmskF9MgpT5Fg_794dfa3f4fb5434ba741aebd67782ef1_Show-on-Screen_-PgM-Cert_Stakeholder-Analysis](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/QqyQX0yCRPmskF9MgpT5Fg_794dfa3f4fb5434ba741aebd67782ef1_Show-on-Screen_-PgM-Cert_Stakeholder-Analysis.svg?expiry=1663545600000&hmac=ydy0NYXUOnxX251a38dTF89MCOG195g7w_z8ZEuAbZ4)

Take the time at the start of the project to establish your stakeholder approach. List the stakeholders and then place them into the appropriate places on the grid. Being able to visualize their placement will help you manage communications and expectations. Having a quick reference tool to drive your communication actions will also allow you to have the ability to spend more time doing other tasks on your project.

**Pro tip:** While these tools help organize information, they do not necessarily make the difference between successful and unsuccessful stakeholder engagement. What will make for successful stakeholder engagement is the project manager’s ability to know their stakeholders’ motivations and inspirations. This takes time, interpersonal skills, and insight into the organization’s internal political workings. Remember, each project is different, and your project may need tweaks along the way as you grow as a project manager. Making necessary changes means you are doing something right. Just make sure to check in and ensure that you are well on track, engaging your stakeholders successfully, and delivering on your project!

**Generating stakeholder buy-in**

Once you organize and assess your stakeholders, it is time to start making some decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require.

Gaining key stakeholder buy-in is essential to ensuring that your project is not deprioritized or deprived of resources. 

Tips for gaining key stakeholder buy-in include:

- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder.

- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team.

- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.

Manage your stakeholders’ expectations by presenting a realistic view of your team’s abilities. Do not over-promise and under-deliver!

**Optional reading**

This article, titled [Roll Call: We Asked the Project Management Community: What Steps Do You Take To Identify and Prioritize All Stakeholders at the Start of a Project?](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/identify-prioritize-stakeholders-11408), describes additional strategies for identifying stakeholders to further increase your understanding.

**Suggested questions for stakeholders**

- What are your most important priorities/goals?

- How will this initiative/project support you and your most important priorities?

- What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?

- Here’s how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?

- What can I clarify for you?

- What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?

- What would success look like for you?

- Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative?

- What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?

- Where do you see me getting support for this initiative? Facing resistance?

- What additional thoughts/questions do you have?

### Activity Overview

In this activity you will complete a stakeholder analysis and power grid.

As a project manager, it’s important to understand how each stakeholder relates to your project. Completing a stakeholder analysis and power grid allows you to determine each stakeholder’s influence and potential impact on a project, which is crucial to managing communications and expectations.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are the project manager at Office Green, a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plants and greenery for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, and you will manage the launch. You and your team need to maintain trust and generate buy-in from your stakeholders. Some of your stakeholders include:

- **Director of Product:** The Director of Product is the project sponsor. As the sponsor, they fully support the project, sign off on high-level decisions, and sometimes act as a resource for the team. They are deeply invested in the outcome of the project, but less involved with its day-to-day operations.

- **Landscape Designer/Web Designer:** This person has two roles at Office Green, and within the Plant Pals project. In addition to their web design skills and knowledge of plants, they have strong relationships with a range of people across the company. The Plant Pals project could affect their role as Landscape Designer if it results in a pivot toward new services. If they don’t want their role to change, it could be harder to get their buy-in.

- **Existing clients and their employees:** The core customers for this product launch are Office Green’s existing clients and their employees. Their feedback can help Office Green improve the customer experience for the new service. Depending on their needs, some clients will be very interested in Plant Pals, while others will be less so. Lower-interest clients are unlikely to resist the project unless it impacts the existing product line.

- **Office Green’s investors:** The investors support Office Green financially, so the company wants to keep them happy. Likewise, because Office Green’s performance affects their investments, the investors want Plant Pals to succeed. However, they will not be directly involved in the project and it will not affect them before launch. They are therefore unlikely to oppose the project at this stage.

- **Office Green’s receptionist:** The receptionist will not be directly involved with the Plant Pals project. They will need to answer customer questions about the service later on, but don’t need to know many details until closer to launch. They have no major concerns about the project at this stage.

**Step-By-Step Instructions**

**Part 1 - Understanding stakeholders with a stakeholder analysis**

**Step 1: Access the template**

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Link to template: [Stakeholder analysis and power grid](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KEQm8p7bve5EuWLHIOR9r1f4XaYaSShyFu0AgH--EZY/template/preview)

**Step 2: Identify stakeholders**

Start with the **Understanding Stakeholders** table on the first slide of the template. This is where you will organize your information. First, identify the stakeholders from the Office Green scenario (e.g., Director of Product, Landscape Designer/Web Designer, etc.) and write their titles in the Stakeholder column of the table.

**Step 3: Determine stakeholder roles**

What roles do your stakeholders play in the project? Write down each team member’s role in the Role column. Select from the following options when determining project roles:

- Project sponsor

- Project team member

- Office Green employee

- Office Green customer 

- Secondary stakeholder

**Step 4: Determine stakeholder involvement**

How will each stakeholder participate in the project? What resources do they have that can help project success? Consider each stakeholder’s involvement in the project, as well as any tools (software, hardware, etc.), knowledge, or relationships that could be helpful. Make note of these activities and assets in the **Involvement** column.

**Step 5: Determine the impact on your stakeholders**

How will the project outcomes affect the needs of each stakeholder? Do you expect any resistance that could affect their buy-in? Record this information in the **Impact** column.

**Step 6: Determine each stakeholder’s level of power or influence**

How much influence does each stakeholder have over the project? Consider the information you added to the **Involvement** and **Impact** columns. Then record each stakeholder’s level of power or influence as high (H), medium (M), or low (L) in the **Power or Influence** column.

_**Note:** You should gauge each stakeholder’s level of influence on this project, not within Office Green in general._

**Step 7: Determine each stakeholder’s level of interest**

How involved is each stakeholder in the project on a daily basis? How much will the project impact the needs of each stakeholder? Estimate each stakeholder’s level of interest in the project at this stage, considering your notes from the **Involvement** and **Impact** columns. Then indicate high (H), medium (M), or low (L) in the **Interest** column.

Be sure to consider interest in project outcomes and interest in day-to-day operations. If a stakeholder is interested in both, their overall interest level is likely high. If neither, their interest could be low. If they are interested in one, but not the other, a medium rating might be appropriate.

Leave the **Engagement** column blank for now. You will return to it once you have completed the power grid.

**Part 2 - Prioritizing stakeholders in a power grid**

**Step 1: Place stakeholders in the power grid**

Now go to the second slide of the template: **Prioritizing Stakeholders (power grid).** Consider your power or influence ratings from the stakeholder analysis. Then drag the box containing each stakeholder’s name to the appropriate place in the power grid.

High-interest, high-power stakeholders should go toward the upper-right corner. Low-interest, low-power stakeholders go toward the lower-left corner, and so forth. You can place stakeholders anywhere on the power grid—even between quadrants. For example, a stakeholder with a medium level of interest would straddle the high and low interest quadrants.

_**Note:** Consult slides 3-5 for a demonstration of how to place your stakeholders._

**Step 2: Determine how to engage with stakeholders**

Now that you’ve placed your stakeholders in the grid, go back to the **Engagement** column in the stakeholder analysis table. Think about where each stakeholder falls in the grid: monitor, show consideration, keep satisfied, or manage closely. 

Based on this information, determine how often you should communicate with each stakeholder and what form that communication should take (e.g. semi-regular consultations, frequent updates, etc.). Depending on their role or resources, you might communicate with them daily, regularly, or rarely. Record your answers in the **Engagement** column.

**Pro Tip: Save the Template**

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the stakeholder analysis and power grid template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. Templates like this one will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to talk through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

**What to Include in Your Response**

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed stakeholder analysis table:

- The table includes all five stakeholders and groups from the scenario.

- The table lists information on each stakeholder’s role, resources, potential resistance, and engagement.

- The table lists each stakeholder’s level of power or influence as low, medium, or high.

- The table lists each stakeholder’s level of interest as low, medium, or high.

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed power grid:

- The grid contains all the stakeholders from your stakeholder analysis. 

- The position of each stakeholder corresponds to their level of interest and influence in your stakeholder analysis.

**Assessment of Exemplar**

Compare the exemplar to your completed stakeholder analysis and power grid. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

_**Note:** Some of the information in your stakeholder analysis and power grid may differ from these exemplars. Some variation is to be expected._

Let’s review the stakeholder analysis table:

- The **Stakeholder** column includes the titles of the five stakeholders (and stakeholder groups) from the scenario. 

- Each stakeholder’s role is in the **Role** column.

- Each stakeholder’s involvement (including helpful tools, knowledge, or relationships) is recorded in the **Involvement** column.

- The project’s impact on each stakeholder’s needs (along with any potential resistance ) is described in the **Impact** column. 

- Each stakeholder’s level of power or influence is classified as high (H), medium (M), or low (L) in the **Power or Influence** column.

- Each stakeholder’s level of interest is classified as high (H), medium (M), or low (L) in the **Interest** column.

- The level and type of engagement determined for each stakeholder is recorded in the **Engagement** column.

Let’s review the power grid:

- As the project sponsor, the **Director of Product** has a **high** level of influence on the project. They are invested in the project’s success, but not involved on a day-to-day basis, so their interest is **medium**. You should communicate with them regularly, but not daily, to ensure they are satisfied with project progress.

- The **Landscape Designer/Web Designer** has a **high** level of both influence and interest, which means you should manage them closely. You should communicate with them daily to discuss project tasks and to ensure you have their buy-in. If you have them on your side, they can help you manage relationships with other Office Green employees.

- **Existing clients and their employees** are the core customer base for Plant Pals, so you need to make sure you’re building something they want to buy. Their feedback can help you measure project success, but you don’t need to communicate with them frequently. Occasional check-ins to gauge their satisfaction are appropriate. This is a large group of people with varying priorities and concerns, so their interest and influence are both marked as **medium**.

- **Office Green’s investors** will not be directly involved in the project, so their interest in daily operations is **low**. However, their influence level is **medium**, since you need to protect their investment to keep their financial support. Giving them periodic updates on project milestones and performance would be appropriate.

- The **Office Green receptionist’s** influence and interest in the project are both relatively **low**. You don’t need to communicate with them often until the project nears completion. They are not part of the project team, and you do not need to discuss the details with them until later in the process.

## Assigning project team roles and responsibilities

### Elements of a RACI chart

In the last video, we saw how a stakeholder analysis shows us how to best work with stakeholders and when to communicate with all the different people involved in the project. In this video, we're going to check out another handy tool called a RACI chart. A RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently. It creates clear roles and gives direction for each team member. There are four types of participation included in a RACI chart. These are: responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed. Let's take a look at each.

Responsible refers to those doing the work to complete the task. Accountable refers to those making sure the work gets done. Consulted includes those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision-makers. And lastly, we have informed, which includes those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete. Here's an image of how this breaks down in a chart form. When creating your RACI chart, you need to write down each task or deliverable for your project, and then assign it the appropriate role for each stakeholder. To do this, first think about who's involved in the project. Write the roles or people's names in a row across the top of your chart.

Pro-tip: use roles rather than names if some people might take on more than one role. Next, write down the tasks or deliverables in a column on the left. Try not to get too specific here. You want the chart to be simple and easy to read. After that, go through each task and deliverable and ask: Who's responsible for doing this? Who's accountable if it doesn't get done? Who will have strong opinions to add, and therefore, should be consulted about how this gets done? And who needs to be informed of the progress or decisions made about this? Assign the letters R, A, C, and I based on your answers. For example, as a project manager on Office Green's new service launch, one of your tasks is to create different price points for different packages and delivery frequencies.

The Head of Finance will be accountable because the project needs to stay in budget and make money, but it's the Financial Analyst who's responsible, as they're the person doing the work in determining optimal pricing. The Director of Product will be consulted on the matter as they oversee the product offerings. And finally, team members, like those on the sales team, need to be informed of the final pricing. It's possible there are several roles that fall into the "informed" and "consulted" categories. One thing that will always remain constant is there will never be more than one person designated as "accountable." This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable clearly defines ownership. However, the same person that is "accountable" may also be "responsible." There are several other factors that can cause role confusion.

For example, there might be unbalanced workloads, which means some people might be doing more work or less work than others on the team. Or there could be an unclear hierarchy when people aren't sure who to seek help from if a task doesn't get done or unclear ownership of decisions where people aren't sure who makes the final call on a project. Another issue could be overlapping work. This is when teams or individuals feel that they're responsible for the same work. When this happens, things can get confusing fast. And the same goes for excessive communication. While communication is usually a good thing, too much communication can actually make things more complicated. It can cause information overload where people don't know what to pay attention to, and so they miss something important. Wow, there's a lot of things that might cause confusion, but all these issues can be resolved or even prevented with a RACI analysis. Be proactive and do this work upfront, and you'll help ensure the success of your project.

### Building out a RACI chart

A **RACI chart** can be an extremely effective way to define project roles, give direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently. Having a RACI chart available throughout the duration of your project as a quick visual can be invaluable. In this reading, we will cover the function of a RACI chart and its components and explore how project managers use RACI charts to define and document project roles and responsibilities.

**Elements of a RACI chart**

A RACI chart creates clear roles and gives direction to each team member and stakeholder. Over your career, you may hear a RACI chart referred to as a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), RACI diagram, or RACI matrix. The ultimate goal of this chart is to clarify each person’s role on your project.

First, let’s break down each of the roles people can be assigned:

**R:** Responsible: who gets the work done

**A:** Accountable: who makes sure the work is done

**C:** Consulted: who gives input or feedback on work

**I:** Informed: who needs to know the outcome

Note that RACI charts can be organized in different ways, depending on personal preference, number of tasks being assigned, and number of people involved. In the previous video, we showed you one RACI chart format. The template below shows another way a typical RACI chart might be organized.

![SAt790MeT0SLe_dDHn9EPg_d57f42ffbe2f478b99e12ce2ca4931f1_Untitled-drawing-3-](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SAt790MeT0SLe_dDHn9EPg_d57f42ffbe2f478b99e12ce2ca4931f1_Untitled-drawing-3-.jpg?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=fwC0Gg7r3k6vhQL5IdcmE2XgiUZ04owTvTRA4EynS7E)

Let’s further examine each of the roles and how to determine which team member should be assigned to which role.

**Responsible**

Individuals who are assigned the “responsible” role for a task are the ones who are actually doing the work to complete the task. Every task needs at least one responsible party. It’s a best practice to try to limit the number of team members assigned to a task’s responsible role, but in some cases, you may have more than one.

A couple of questions to ask yourself when determining which person or people should be placed in the responsible role for a given task are:

- What department does the work fall under?

- Who will perform the work?

It is helpful to evaluate the people on your team to determine the role that suits them. Remember that you may need to list roles rather than names, if some people take on more than one role.

Let’s dig deeper into our example with Office Green. Our task is to develop price points for the project, and the Financial Analyst will complete the work for this task. Therefore, we will list “Financial Analyst” in the responsible role for this task in the RACI chart.

![72SX7rAuQDykl-6wLgA8UA_b81e3cb7a5c54012b13dcf29401529f1_Untitled-drawing-4-](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/72SX7rAuQDykl-6wLgA8UA_b81e3cb7a5c54012b13dcf29401529f1_Untitled-drawing-4-.jpg?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=zWvGXlxJq-dL-5TQRSaz0DkbBs_cmcpO7D9mMYzoeGs)

**Accountable**

The “accountable” person is responsible for making sure the task gets done. It is important to have only one individual accountable for each task. This helps clarify ownership of the task. The accountable person ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable of the responsible party.

In order to determine who should be tagged as the accountable team member, consider:

- Who will delegate the task to be completed?

- Who will review the work to determine if the task is complete?

You may encounter a situation where the responsible party is also accountable, but where possible, it is helpful to separate these roles. Ensuring that accountability is not shared ensures that there is no confusion on who the ownership belongs to.

Continuing with our Office Green example, you have assigned the “accountable” role to the Head of Finance. The Head of Finance has to make sure the project stays in budget and makes a profit, so they have the ultimate authority over the price points for the product. Therefore, they will need to approve the Financial Analyst’s work on the task.

![lq4unws0TTOuLp8LNB0z6Q_ae9c538c1a884084807d05cd1ab2def1_Untitled-drawing-5-](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/lq4unws0TTOuLp8LNB0z6Q_ae9c538c1a884084807d05cd1ab2def1_Untitled-drawing-5-.jpg?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=A67TpBsiqeMck847ehr3HEwHwTxNOu5yUFf7Z2LQkjw)

**Consulted**

Team members or stakeholders who are placed in the “consulted” role have useful information to help complete the task. There is no maximum or minimum number of people who can be assigned a “consulted” role, but it’s important that each person has a reason for being there.

Here are a few ways you can help identify who is appropriate for the role:

- Who will the task impact?

- Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?

- Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?

The consulted people will be in frequent, two-way communication with the responsible party, so it is key to make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the task efficiently and correctly.

Back to the project at Office Green, we’ve got a “responsible” Financial Analyst and an “accountable” Head of Finance. Who else would need to provide input on the product’s price points? Whose decisions and feedback will directly affect the task? The Director of Product will need to be consulted on the matter, as they oversee all product offerings. This person will have information about potential changes to the product and how these changes might affect price points.

![-LkkK3EHR9K5JCtxB5fS0g_3327debdefd448c4838982337badb8f1_Untitled-drawing-6-](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/-LkkK3EHR9K5JCtxB5fS0g_3327debdefd448c4838982337badb8f1_Untitled-drawing-6-.jpg?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=i0vKDRAwgu_UjgW3Hxq2HfD5p8r1Cb6o20rt2L31lrs)

**Informed**

Individuals who are identified as needing to be “informed” need to know the final decisions that were made and when a task is completed. It is common to have many people assigned to this category and for some team members to be informed on most tasks. Team members or stakeholders here will not be asked for feedback, so it is key to make sure people who are in this group only require status updates and do not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the effort.

Key questions to ask yourself in order to ensure that you have appropriately captured individuals in the “informed” role are:

- Who cares about this task’s completion?

- Who will be affected by the outcome?

Now that you’ve determined who is responsible, accountable, and consulted on the Office Green project task, it is time to determine who needs to be informed about the task. Your Financial Analyst has set the price points with input from the Director of Product, and the Head of Finance has approved. You will now need to inform the Sales Team about the final price points, as they will need this information to sell the product.

![qR2hCzOMTqydoQszjF6suA_a0c63c8aa550426d8705852c6c0b27f1_Untitled-drawing-7-.jpg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qR2hCzOMTqydoQszjF6suA_a0c63c8aa550426d8705852c6c0b27f1_Untitled-drawing-7-.jpg?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=EW4Gw_Y1FdEJrVhywPtdW4E0Dzob9nrNRks1iWaeFE0)

**Pro tip:** You could end up with a large number of team members and stakeholders who are placed in the “informed” role. If so, make sure that you have a plan to keep them informed that is not labor-intensive. Something as easy as view-only access to your project plan or meeting notes could prevent you from having to create separate communications along the way.

**Key takeaway**

The RACI chart is a valuable tool. It can help you define and document project roles and responsibilities, give direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently. A RACI chart can also help you analyze and balance the workload of your team. While it may take many revisions to make sure that your team members and stakeholders are being placed into the right roles in your RACI chart, doing this work up front helps save time and prevent miscommunications later on.

### Activity: Set project roles and responsibilities in a RACI chart

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will use a RACI chart to assign roles and responsibilities to project stakeholders. You will analyze a scenario and determine each stakeholder’s relationship to project tasks and deliverables.

As a reminder, RACI charts help you determine who is:

- **R**esponsible

- **A**ccountable

- **C**onsulted

- **I**nformed

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As the project manager for Plant Pals, you must assemble a team that can develop and execute the marketing and sales strategy to prepare for the launch. You must also assign roles and responsibilities for each of the project tasks and identify stakeholders impacted by the project. You’ve determined that the following people will be involved:

- **Director of Product:** Oversees the product offerings, and serves as a resource for marketing and sales questions. Their knowledge of customer needs is vital to the project. 

- **Marketing Manager:** Makes key decisions about the service launch and monitors task completion. They oversee all marketing efforts, including concept development, and sign off on the service launch plan. 

- **Marketing Coordinator:** Creates the marketing strategy, including all marketing assets. They work closely with the Copywriter and report to the Marketing Manager. 

- **Copywriter:** Produces all Plant Pals ad content, writes product descriptions, and creates promotional copy. They work with the Marketing Coordinator on all aspects of the marketing strategy and report to the Marketing Manager.

- **Head of Sales:** Sets Office Green’s overall sales strategy and tracks the company’s progress towards its sales goals. Their knowledge of customers’ buying behaviors can help the marketing team develop their campaign. The Head of Sales oversees the Sales Manager.

- **Sales Manager:** Responsible for customer outreach and relationship management strategies, so that Office Green meets its sales goals. They need to understand the final marketing strategy and product offerings and convey that information to the Sales team. The Sales Manager reports to the Head of Sales.

To develop and execute the marketing strategy and sales, your team must complete the following tasks:

1. Create a marketing plan for the new service

2. Write promotional copy 

3. Design marketing assets (e.g., flyers, brochures, and online advertisements)

4. Create a customer outreach and onboarding plan

**Step-By-Step Instructions**

**Step 1: Access the template**

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Link to template: [RACI Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QOb3miFWQvYWH7IrxW4F7GY0YCH2E6rHTZnVDM1IeYE/template/preview)

**Step 2: Add tasks to the RACI chart**

Add the four tasks from the scenario to your RACI chart template under the Task/Deliverable heading. Replace “Task/Deliverable” with the name of each task.

**Step 3: Add team members to the RACI chart**

Add your team members to the template. Replace “Role A” with “Director of Product,” and so on.

**Step 4: Assign letters in the RACI chart**

For each task, assign the letters **R,** **A,** **C,** and **I** to the team members involved. Consult the descriptions below to determine how your team members relate to the tasks:

**Responsible:** Who is responsible for completing this task? Consider these questions when determining who is responsible:

- Which department manages the work?

- Who should perform the work?

**Accountable:** Who is accountable if the task isn’t completed? Remember that only one person should be accountable for each task or deliverable. When deciding who is accountable, ask yourself: 

- Who might delegate the task to another team member?

- Who makes final decisions about the task?

- Who should review the work to confirm it is complete?

**Consulted:** Who should be consulted for their insights, expertise, or strong opinions on the task? Here are a few questions to help identify whether someone should be consulted:

- Who can give feedback to responsible individuals to help them complete tasks? 

- Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?

**Informed:** Who should be kept informed about task progress or project decisions? Key questions to ask yourself include: 

- Who is invested in task completion but not directly involved in the work? 

- Who is affected by the project outcome?

_**Note:** The number of stakeholders you keep informed about each task can vary depending on your situation. In some cases, you might choose to inform all stakeholders who aren't responsible, accountable, or consulted. In others, you could leave some cells in your RACI chart blank for certain tasks. Both approaches are fine for this activity._

**Pro Tip: Save the template**

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the RACI chart template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

**What to Include in Your Response**

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed RACI chart:

- The RACI chart includes all of the project roles from the scenario.

- The RACI chart includes all the deliverables/tasks from the scenario. 

- The appropriate individuals are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

- Only one individual is accountable for each task or deliverable.

- At least one individual is responsible for each task. (_**Note:** Some tasks may not need Consulted or Informed individuals._)

_**Note:** Your answers may vary (particularly for Consulted and Informed individuals), depending how you interpreted each stakeholder’s responsibilities._

In the exemplar for the Plant Pals service, each role has a RACI designation for each task or deliverable. Let’s review each of the tasks:

**Create a marketing plan for the new service.**

- The Marketing Coordinator reports to the Marketing Manager and is **responsible** for creating the marketing plan.

- The Marketing Manager is **accountable** for marketing efforts, including the marketing concept. They have the final say in launching and advertising the Plant Pals service. 

- The Copywriter writes and edits the promotional copy, therefore they are **consulted** on the marketing plan.

- The Director of Product and Head of Sales are **consulted** on marketing campaigns since they understand customer needs and buying behaviors. 

- The Sales Manager can be kept **informed** of marketing efforts since they need to convey that information to the Sales Team. 

**Write promotional copy.**

- The Copywriter is **responsible** for drafting and editing promotional copy.

- The Marketing Manager is **accountable** for the Copywriter’s work. 

- The Marketing Coordinator is **consulted** on the promotional and sales copy as they create the marketing plan. 

- All other members of the team can be kept **informed** about the status of the promotional copy.

**Design marketing assets.**

- The Marketing Manager delegates tasks to the Marketing Coordinator, who is **responsible** for producing assets.

- The Marketing Manager is **accountable** for marketing efforts because they make the final decisions.

- The Copywriter is **consulted** about the marketing assets by the Marketing Coordinator. 

- All other team members can be kept **informed** about marketing design matters.

**Create a customer outreach and onboarding plan**

- The Sales Manager is **responsible** for customer outreach and onboarding plan. 

- The Head of Sales oversees the Sales Manager, so they are **accountable** for the customer outreach and onboarding plan.

- The Director of Product is **consulted** on questions about customer needs, while the Marketing Manager is **consulted** about the marketing plan.

- All other team members can be kept **informed** about customer outreach.

### Certificate completers: Staying motivated in the program

If something is stumping you or you feel stuck at a certain aspect, there's always someone else who's going through the same thing. Anytime I started to feel overwhelmed by information or like I just wasn't getting it. I wasted so much time being unsure of myself that I should have just listened to my friends and family when they said just do it, you can do it. One of the greatest things that help me to get back motivated is the accessibility of the course on my phone.

I was just able to go into the app and listen to a few videos, because I can learn a lot on the go. Having a network of people that motivates you—it's so fundamental. Even if it's a friend or if it's a family member that you can get from the beginning, and he can be there for you on your corner like a coach. And don't be afraid to ask for help, whether it be from your peers, from your coaches, friends, family. There's always someone who knows more, and you can learn from them.

### Getting the most out of a RACI chart

In the previous video, you learned how critical a **RACI chart** is for creating clear roles and giving direction to each team member on a project. In this reading, we will further explore the function and components of RACI charts and how to use them to communicate responsibilities to project teams.

**Definition and structure**

Determining who is **R**esponsible, **A**ccountable, **C**onsulted and **I**nformed on your projects allows you to keep control of the stakeholders roles on your project.

![mxerqpNdR6qXq6qTXeeqJg_1da67efcf97f49b787ce50c5d857408f_C2M3L3R2-1-](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mxerqpNdR6qXq6qTXeeqJg_1da67efcf97f49b787ce50c5d857408f_C2M3L3R2-1-.png?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=nROtqlVjgczjSua_tljduLrCgkdykI3H5LjK97aOvnA)

**Workload balance**

Are there too many tasks assigned to one stakeholder? When you complete your chart, it is a good idea to go back through and tally the number of Rs assigned to each stakeholder. This can help you identify potentially overloading one team member with work. Using a RACI chart to determine responsibility for tasks can help mitigate single points of failure (known as creating **silos**, where the knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on one person) and allow you, as the project manager, to delegate tasks and avoid burnout. Maintaining workload balance is a critical part of project management. It is easy to fall into the pattern of relying on your top performers to keep the project moving forward. But this isn’t always healthy for the project or your team. If you find that you don’t have the right people to assign responsibilities to, take a step back and evaluate your team.

**Put your RACI into practice**

Once you have created your RACI chart, it is time to put it into practice. You will first need to share your RACI chart with your sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off. When you get stakeholder buy-in, you will be able to set clear expectations for your team and ensure that everyone is aligned on their responsibilities. 

You can document your team and stakeholders’ acknowledgment of these expectations through the project charter, meeting notes, and in the RACI chart itself. Think back to a time when you were expected to do something you did not agree with, or weren’t clear on. That disagreement or lack of clarity made it difficult to do your best work, right? Getting buy-in and continually checking in with your stakeholders and your team is the way to avoid this potential pitfall! 

As you take the time to ensure that each task has an owner identified with the appropriate level of engagement, you are streamlining your communication and decision-making process over the life cycle of your project.

**When should you use a RACI chart?**

If you are wondering if you should use a RACI chart on your project, it is a good idea to evaluate the complexity of the effort. For example, if you have a very small project team with a small amount of stakeholders, clearly defined roles, and a short timeline, introducing a RACI chart could possibly slow down the project. However, larger projects, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholders, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall.

### Activity: Assign project roles and responsibilities in a RACI chart

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will apply your knowledge of RACI charts to a new phase of project planning. You will analyze a scenario about the execution phase of the Plant Pals project. Then you will use a RACI chart to determine each stakeholder’s relationship to project tasks.

As a reminder, RACI charts help you determine who is:

- **R**esponsible

- **A**ccountable

- **C**onsulted

- **I**nformed

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As the lead project manager for the Plant Pals project, you’re managing the launch of this new service. Previously, you worked with your project team as they developed a marketing plan, wrote promotional copy, designed marketing assets, and created a sales plan for customer outreach.

Now you are gathering a new team to design and develop the Plant Pals landing page. When potential customers click on Plant Pals advertisements, the landing page is the first part of the Office Green website they will see. The team members you need to build the landing page include: 

- **Web Manager:** Makes final decisions about new site features and content changes. They sign off on the landing page design and launch plans. They also coordinate maintenance and management tasks to keep the page operating smoothly. 

- **Graphic Designer:** Creates and chooses images and typefaces for the landing page and submits them to the Web Designer for approval. They also provide feedback on the landing page design and mockup. 

- **Web Developer:** Supports the product team by writing the code that powers the site. They give feedback to the Web Designer on the landing page mockup. The Web Developer also helps set quality standards for the project.

- **Quality Assurance Tester:** Reviews system specifications and runs quality tests for the new landing page. They run test scripts and review results, create reports, and document technical issues. These tests identify problems that the team can then resolve before launch. 

- **Content Writer:** Creates the written content that explains how Plant Pals works and helps potential customers sign up for the service. They give feedback to the Web Designer on the landing page mockup.

- **Web Designer:** Creates the landing page design, determining how the page looks and how customers interact with it. The Web Designer connects the creative and technical elements of the project, ensuring that the website is both attractive and functional. They report to the Web Manager, who makes final decisions on new site features.

To build and launch a landing page for Plant Pals, the team needs to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Design a landing page 

2. Create a landing page mockup

3. Design image assets

4. Write content

5. Code the landing page

6. Test the landing page

**Step-by-step instructions:**

**Step 1: Access the template**

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Link to template: [RACI Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RQdqrHC1UgpUizkC-hMkRhMV24TIDST7SVt0pGW68s8/template/preview)

**Step 2: Add tasks to the RACI chart**

Add the six tasks from the scenario to your RACI chart template under the **Task/Deliverable** heading. Replace “Task/Deliverable” with the name of each task.

**Step 3: Assign roles to the RACI chart**

Update the **Role** headers with each team member role from the scenario. Replace “Role A” with “Web Manager,” and so on.

**Step 4: Assign letters in the RACI chart**

For each task, assign the letters **R,** **A,** **C,** and **I** to the team members involved. Consult the descriptions below to determine how your team members relate to the tasks:

**Responsible:** Who is responsible for completing this task? Consider these questions when determining who is responsible:

- Which department manages the work?

- Who should perform the work?

**Accountable:** Who is accountable if the task isn’t completed? Remember that only one person should be accountable for each task or deliverable. When deciding who is accountable, ask yourself: 

- Who might delegate the task to another team member?

- Who makes final decisions about the task?

- Who should review the work to confirm it is complete?

**Consulted:** Who should be consulted for their insights, expertise, or strong opinions on the task? Here are a few questions to help identify whether someone should be consulted:

- Who can give feedback to responsible individuals to help them complete tasks? 

- Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?

**Informed:** Who should be kept informed about task progress or project decisions? Key questions to ask yourself include: 

- Who is invested in task completion but not directly involved in the work? 

- Who is affected by the project outcome?

_**Note:** The number of stakeholders you keep informed about each task can vary depending on your situation. In some cases, you might choose to inform all stakeholders who aren't responsible, accountable, or consulted. In others, you could leave some cells in your RACI chart blank for certain tasks. Both approaches are fine for this activity._

**Pro Tip: Save the Template**

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the RACI chart template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. Templates like this one will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to talk through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

**What to Include in Your Response**

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed RACI chart: 

- The RACI chart includes all of the project roles.

- The RACI chart includes all the tasks. 

- The appropriate individuals are listed as **Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.**

- Only one individual is accountable for each deliverable/task.

- At least one individual is responsible for each task. (Note that some tasks may not need Consulted or Informed individuals.)

### Why projects fail: Initiation missteps

You have been learning the necessary planning steps to take in order to set a project up for success. But despite your best efforts, projects can still fail. Sometimes the factors that lead to project failure are out of your control. The technology to complete the project is unavailable, for example, or a stakeholder decides to drastically change the goals of the project. However, there are factors that can lead to failure that are more in your control, such as being unable to complete the project deliverables within the agreed upon time or being unable to fulfill the stakeholder’s vision for the project.

In this reading, we will explore a few key reasons why projects fail and examine how missteps during the initiation phase can lead to project failure.

**Unclear expectations**

You may remember the questions you need to answer at the start of the initiation phase of the project, including: 

- What is the end goal? 

- What are the expected deliverables and schedule? 

- What is the budget? 

- Who are the stakeholders?

Not taking the time at the beginning of a project to ask essential questions, document decisions, and understand the true scope of the project may lead to failure. After all, without directions, you can never reach your destination.

**Unrealistic expectations**

We all like to impress our managers, but sometimes, we accidentally agree to unrealistic expectations and set our projects up for failure from the start. For example, if a project is expected to take two weeks due to the level of detail and effort required but we try to complete it in one week, we will not have the resources available to meet the consolidated schedule. This will likely result in quality issues. It’s important to understand the requirements of a project before agreeing to any deadlines. As a best practice, don't commit to firm dates when initiating the project to avoid setting unrealistic expectations. You will have more information and will be able to better manage expectations in the planning phase.

**Miscommunication**

Clear communication is key. If information is not communicated in a timely manner, does not include pertinent information (risks, decisions made, scope changes, etc.), or is not sent to the correct stakeholders, then you may be setting yourself up for failure. Conducting a stakeholder analysis and then utilizing a RACI chart to understand which stakeholders should be kept informed or consulted is a great start to creating an effective communication strategy.

As a project manager, you do not necessarily have to cater to everyone’s unique communication styles, but you do have to set expectations about how communication will occur. As you are kicking off a project, make sure you take some time to understand the communication needs of your team and stakeholders. Some people dislike emails and would prefer to have a phone conversation, some prefer to have communication in writing, and some prefer face-to-face meetings. A strong communication system incorporates all of these methods. Set expectations for your communication approach early so that you, your team members, and your stakeholders have a clear understanding of how you will all communicate.

**Lack of resources**

Resources include your team members, budget, and materials. Unfortunately, without proper planning, your resources can quickly be over-tasked or depleted. Sometimes project managers don’t account for the fact that team members are juggling multiple tasks and may not be able to devote the time necessary to complete all of their assigned tasks correctly and on time. Or, project managers may not realize that a specific skill set is required to complete certain tasks. Ensuring that the right team members are available at the right time is crucial.

Another common error is to incorrectly calculate your project expenses. For example, imagine you have a project budget of $10,000. If your project requires $10,000 for materials and you also have to ship and install those materials, then you will not have enough money to complete your project. Clarify your resource needs and confirm their availability with leadership up front to avoid delays or issues further along in the project.

**Scope creep**

The scope provides an overarching framework of what is and is not included in the project’s work and deliverables. Defining the scope in the initiation phase helps identify the resources needed, the cost associated with those resources, and the schedule required to complete the work. Sometimes projects fail because the scope of the project grows and impacts to the scope are not captured. 

For example, imagine that you are given a project that originally includes three deliverables. During the course of the project, a stakeholder requests that two additional deliverables be included, but no changes are made to the schedule, budget, or team members to reflect the impact of the increased number of deliverables. As a project manager, when deliverables change, you have to make sure that you are capturing the potential impact of those changes to the schedule, budget, and quality. This is why it is so important to make sure that everything is documented in the initiation phase. Have a plan for how to handle scope creep if it occurs, and clarify who has the authority to approve scope changes.

**Key takeaway**

Taking the time to clarify expectations—particularly around communication methods, resources available, and scope—during the initiation phase will increase the chances of your project’s success. Even if you follow these best practices, you may still encounter failure. Remember that in every failure, there is the opportunity to learn, grow, and do better the next time.

### Wrap-up

Kudos! You finished another module. That was a fun one! We covered a lot of topics that were likely new to you. So let's recap. In our first video, we checked out each individual role associated with projects. You learned that as a project manager, you'll have to ask yourself key questions to make sure you build a successful team. You have to consider things like team size, necessary skills, availability, and motivation. Then you completed a stakeholder analysis. This helps you understand how you might manage communication with each person on the project.

Next came the RACI chart, which defined rules and responsibilities for individuals or teams. This helps people get work done efficiently, and it creates clear lanes and instruction for each team member to operate within. It does this by assigning which roles are responsible, accountable, informed, and consulted. Overall, you learned some really useful concrete tools to help you stay organized throughout the project. You can use these charts as you work with your stakeholders. And if your project is ever-evolving, as some are, stakeholder mapping and RACI charting will help you stay on top of the tasks and communicate effectively. In the next module, you'll learn about other useful resources for managing projects and discover how to know which tool to use when. See you soon.

## WEEK 4 - Module 2

## Understanding project resource needs

### Introduction: Utilizing resources and tools for project success

Welcome back, and congrats on completing that graded assessment. In the previous module, you learned all about project roles and responsibilities, and we introduced you to some tools that you can use to ensure team accountability, like stakeholder analyses and RACI charts. Coming up, we'll talk about project tools and resources, and the value of documentation. By the end of this module, you'll understand the types of resources available to a project manager, you'll be able to document information in a formal project charter, and you'll be able to compare and use various project management tools. Ready to get started? Meet me in the next video.

### Essential project resources

So far, you've learned how to determine project goals and scope, and how to identify the right stakeholders for a project. Now it's time to add another important ingredient: resources. As a project manager, understanding your resource needs is crucial to achieving your goals. So during the initiation phase, it's important to ask yourself what are the things we still need to acquire in order to complete our project? Project resources usually include budget, people, and materials. You'll use tools to manage all those resources. As you think about the goals and the scope of the project, you figure out the different resources you'll need to meet those goals. It's important to figure out your resources before the project gets rolling. This makes it easy for everyone on your team to get their work done, and that's your job as a project manager.

You won't be doing the work directly, but you'll support the people who do. Figuring out resources early on also helps you avoid accidentally understaffing your project, which can seriously slow down team progress and eat away at the overall timeline. Even worse, if you're not careful with your resource planning, you could wind up underestimating the budget. Meaning, you might not have enough money to purchase necessary materials, hire vendors, or support overtime requests. Planning your resources early is a great way to set your team up for success. Because when your teammates have what they need to do their work on time and on budget, they are better set up to meet the project's goals. Now, let's break down some of the resources that project managers typically work with. First, let's talk about budgets. A budget is an estimate of the amount of money a project will cost to complete. Almost all projects have budgets because they need funding for expenses, like buying the right materials or software, hiring vendors to complete jobs, or doing marketing once the project's done.

During the initiation phase, you'll talk to the stakeholders and the people working on the project to figure out the tasks needed to get the project done. Here, you might ask questions to help uncover hidden costs. For example, are there any taxes on products that you need to account for? What about extra fees? All this information will help you create a budget, which you can use to source and compare proposals from vendors, figure out upcoming costs, and track all the money moving in and out of your project. You'll often include the budget and the project charter, and the stakeholders review it for approval. We'll talk more about what goes into creating a project budget and creating a project charter later on. When we talk about resources, we're also talking about the team of people who help execute the tasks of a project. For example, you, as the project manager are a resource. So is the marketing manager who might create advertisements for this new product.

Other resources can include people outside of your company who have unique skills and can do certain tasks that people in your organization can't do personally. Then, you have materials. These are items you need to help get the project done. For example, project materials might include the lumber needed to complete a construction project, okay? So you know that project resources include budget, people, and materials. How do you organize these resources? That's actually a nice transition into our next topic which is: tools. Tools are aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to manage resources and organize work. They help you do things like track tasks, manage budgets, and collaborate with teammates. There are all kinds of tools out there including productivity tools like Google Docs and work management software like Asana.

We'll talk more about these tools later in this program. Tools are essential for tracking progress, so you want to keep them top of mind at all phases of your project. Let's talk about how you might determine your resources during the initiation phase of your project at Office Green. As a reminder, the Plant Pal Service offers customers small low maintenance plants like cacti and leafy ferns that they can place on their desks. Customers can order them online or from a print catalogue, and Office Green will ship the plant straight to the customer's work address. The project goal is to increase revenue by 5%. So how do you get started? Well, you might do some research to figure out the cost of launching the new plant service. That might include the estimated prices of developing a new website, a new promotional materials, as well as shipping and delivery costs.

You also might want to budget for specific tools, like a project management software that will help you track progress on this complex project. With that information, you can start to build a realistic budget and you'll also need to figure out who's working on this project with you. To do this, you might make a list of people and external vendors who will help complete all the projects' tasks. For example, the person who manages client communications with customers or a new plant supplier that can provide you with your product. Great, hopefully, you're getting more comfortable with the types of resources you'll need not only to get stuff done, but to achieve your projects goals, too. In the next video, we'll talk about documentation, another important topic for anyone who manages projects professionally.

### Managing resources to get the job done

![bmWVKKxZQSmllSisWcEpyg_d42b2c829c8b4d7bbc3a77155dd172f1_money_people_tools](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bmWVKKxZQSmllSisWcEpyg_d42b2c829c8b4d7bbc3a77155dd172f1_money_people_tools.png?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=tjU_yr9hUxRZqQrCs3BHjVTNJPfyWNGV6AVpl6_SIos)

As we continue learning the tools and techniques that will help you succeed in project management, let’s consider the importance of **project resources.** Project resources are who and what you depend on to complete a project, including budget, materials, and people. While each resource is a separate entity, they all depend on one another—your team cannot do the work without materials, and you cannot purchase materials without a budget. In this reading, we will discuss some key project resources and tips for managing them.

**Budget**

Have you ever created a budget for yourself or your family? If you have, you know that a budget includes a wide variety of expenses. For example, a monthly personal budget can contain items that include anything from food to transportation costs to rent. With only a certain amount of funding to cover each expense, it is important to closely monitor your spending to avoid going over budget. If you go over in one category of your budget, you will impact the others and will need to make adjustments. As a project manager, you will take the same general approach with your project budget.

Common aspects of your project budget will include:

- Team: the cost of the people performing the work

- Services: any outside vendors helping your project

- Materials: any tangible items purchased to complete the project

Throughout your project management career, you will encounter various types of projects with a wide range of budgets. Some budgets will have no margin for error, whereas other budgets may be more flexible. Regardless of this variability, budget issues will inevitably arise, so it is important to make sure that the budget is aligned with the project scope and the stakeholders’ asks.

**People**

People are a vital resource on your project; you cannot complete your project on your own! You will need to rely on a strong team of people with a variety of skill sets and specialties to get the job done. As a project manager, make sure that you have commitment and buy-in on the number of hours it will take for your resources to complete their tasks. Additionally, you will find the best partners on a project are people who are aligned to the goals of the project or who are most interested in the project's work.

**Materials**

Materials can be different on every project. For example, if you were working on an IT project, materials could include hard drives and computers to handle the coding efforts. You can also have materials that are intangible. For example, on the same IT project, online storage, software programs, or employee training may also be considered materials. It is important to account for any and all potential materials in order to execute a successful project with the right people and within budget.

**Key takeaway**

Your project resources include things like the budget, people, and materials. As a project manager, remembering that your resources are dependent on one another is key to understanding the function of each resource and determining how to manage all of them. Take the time to interview stakeholders and potential team members about what resources they think they will need in order to deliver the project. They may have an idea of materials they require that you may not have accounted for within the budget, for example, or can identify people with expertise that would make them an asset to the project team. 

Next, we will discuss project charters, which are an important tool that project managers use to gain clarity on the resources that they will need for a project.

## Developing documentation for project kick-off

### The value of project documentation

By now, you've probably noticed that a big part of project management is guiding decision-making. Even if you're not the one making final decisions on major aspects of the project, it's still your job to keep track of every new decision and use those decisions to create a plan. As you've learned, there are a lot of important decisions to keep track of. That includes everything from identifying project goals and deliverables to choosing the right people to add to a team. It's way too much for any one person to mentally keep track of. It's also important information for everyone on the team to be aware of; not just the project manager. If a decision affects a member of the team's tasks, they'll need to know about it, right? That's why documentation is such an important part of a project manager's role. While your team may work deeply on specific areas of the project, you might be the only person on the team who is aware of and communicating across all the different areas of the project.

Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear communication. Documentation helps set the stage for the project. It communicates the answers to key questions. For example, what problem are you trying to solve? What are the project goals? What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project's stakeholders? Lastly, what resources does the team need to complete their work? This is all crucial information for anyone who's working on a project, regardless of their role. Documentation also helps preserve decisions made early on in the project and can serve as a reference point for team members who might join later in the project life cycle. It's your job to ensure that this information is easily accessible through some kind of formal documentation, like an e-mail, a presentation, or a digital document. Also, documenting decisions can help you uncover tasks, timelines, or costs you hadn't previously considered. And lastly, this process provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the end of your project. You can apply the lessons you've learned in the future. Ok, let's get into different types of documentation. Up next, we'll look at project proposals and project charters, two types of documents that can set you up for success early on. See you soon!

### Project proposals and charters 101

Hello, and welcome back. Earlier, we discussed the value of documentation in effective project management. Now let's talk about two common types of documentation you could use to keep track of details and keep your stakeholders informed. These are: the project proposal and the project charter. A project proposal is a form of documentation that comes at the very beginning of the project. This document's purpose is to persuade stakeholders that a project should begin. And typically, a senior organizational leader creates the proposal. So you might not need to worry about creating the proposal, but you will have to keep track of the proposal's progress. The project proposal is a great starting point to help you understand the desired goals and impact. A proposal may be a formal document, a presentation, or even a simple email to get others on board with the idea. Then, we have the project charter: a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach its goals. A project charter helps you get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others.

So how do these documents differ? A project proposal is created earlier in the project life cycle than the project charter. The proposal kicks off the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project. The project charter serves a similar purpose and often comes at the end of the initiation phase. However, its goal is to more clearly define the key details of the project. Another difference between these two documents is that a charter will often serve as a point of reference throughout the life of a project. The proposal is only used at the earlier stages. Now that you know the difference between these two documents, let's take a closer look at the project charter, which you'll learn more about in this module. The project charter makes clear that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs. As you learned earlier in this course, there are a few questions you might ask yourself when performing a cost benefit analysis. That includes questions like: What value will this project create? And how much money could this project save my organization? How much time will people have to spend on this project? You'll include the answers to these questions in your charter. Including this type of information ensures that you and your stakeholders agree on the project value.

The charter also helps ensure that you and your stakeholders agree on the details of the project. Project charter approval means that management is supportive, and it's also a key step to ensure that the project matches the needs of the organization. After the stakeholders and project sponsor have reviewed and approved the project charter, you now have the authority to move forward with the project. Project charters can be formatted in a few ways and can contain different information depending on the project and the organization. The information in a charter might also be tailored to its audience or the needs of specific stakeholders. For example, if you're writing a project charter for a stakeholder who is a marketing executive, the charter might include information about how the project will impact the organization's brand. Or if the stakeholder is a chief technology officer, the charter might include information on the cost of engineering resources needed to maintain the project. Regardless of the format or the audience, creating a project charter is a best practice for ensuring that everyone agrees on how to move forward before entering the planning phase. The project charter is a living document. This means that it can evolve as the project progresses. As the project manager, you'll review and refine the charter throughout the process. Now that you know more about the value of a project charter, it's time to learn how to create one. Meet me in the next video to get started!

### Project charters: Elements and formats

A **project charter** clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals. A well-documented project charter can be a project manager’s secret weapon to success. In this reading, we will go over the function, key elements, and significance of a project charter and learn how to create one. 

The charter is the formal way that the project’s goals, values, benefits, and details are captured. You can think of the charter as the compass for your project since you will use it throughout the life cycle of the project. Many stakeholders will look to your project charter to ensure that you are indeed aligned with strategic goals and set up for achieving the desired end goal. Since the project charter carries so much importance, it is important to incorporate the right amount of detail while omitting miscellaneous elements.

As with any of your project documents, it is a good idea to collaborate with your team and stakeholders early and often. Developing the project charter in collaboration with both groups can help you make sure that your project charter addresses your key stakeholders’ most important concerns and keeps your team aligned. Be sure to use the business case—the reason for initiating the project—as the guiding direction to your project charter. Project charters can vary from organization to organization and from project to project. It is key for a project manager to identify the best type of charter for the project in order to capture the relevant information and set your project up for success.

Project charters will vary but usually include some combination of the following key information:

- introduction/project summary

- goals/objectives 

- business case/benefits and costs

- project team

- scope

- success criteria

- major requirements or key deliverables

- budget

- schedule/timeline or milestones

- constraints and assumptions

- risks

- OKRs

- approvals

You will likely use many different project charter formats throughout your project management career. One example is a condensed, simplified document, like the one you'll learn about in the upcoming video and the one linked in the activities. A short and simple project charter can be used on smaller projects that are not very complex.

![sDMSHLUqSYyzEhy1KjmMSA_592feb8ec062452e905649cf325961f1_Project-charter](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/sDMSHLUqSYyzEhy1KjmMSA_592feb8ec062452e905649cf325961f1_Project-charter.jpg?expiry=1663632000000&hmac=EZ-EX8eecdmmuajmu1GwuIwmU1OboOX1U_YH9STocHo)

For more complex projects, you may link to additional analysis or documents. You can house these items in the appendix. 

Your organization may have a unique template for you to use, or you may have the flexibility to leverage one you come across in your career. As your project progresses, you may also encounter revisions to your project charter—and that is okay. Remember, it is a living document; let it grow with your project, and review and revisit it often to ensure you are aligned.

### Developing a project charter

Hi again. Let's talk about how to create a project charter. In the last video we discussed how project charters, are a valuable document for project managers. Project charters are key for securing approval from stakeholders and moving forward. Project charters can also be formatted in many different ways and there are many different templates available online for you to choose from. Here, we'll use a template that's similar to one that program managers often use at google and to fill in each section will use details from your project at Office Green, ready? Let's take a look! At the top of your charter, you'll want to add in the name of your project. Let's add in the name of your project at Office Green, it's called: Project Plant Pals. You also want to add in a brief summary, let's type that in. Our plan is to offer high volume customers, small, low maintenance plants that can thrive in an office environment.

Next up, let's fill in the section labeled "project goals." Remember that goals should be smart. Let's add in the goal for Project Plant Pals which is to increase revenue by five percent by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to top clients by the end of the year. Great, now let's add in the project deliverable. Remember that a deliverable is a tangible outcome from a project. As you learned earlier, our deliverables for this project are to send 1000 plants to 100 customers and to launch a new website for orders and customer support. Okay, now let's add in the business case, which captures the reasoning for initiating this project. Let's type in: "this is a top requested service from our customers and it will also improve customer satisfaction and retention."

The business case is supported by the cost benefit analysis and we'll add that in now. We'll start with the benefits. The benefits or expected gains of the project, include improving customer satisfaction and an increase in revenue. Now, we'll move on to the costs. The costs include the price of the sourcing products, developing a website and marketing materials. Let's type in: "$250,000" for the estimated budget. Nice, we've now outlined some of the benefits and costs of this project. Keep in mind that these are simple examples to teach you the basics of filling out a charter. When running a real project, you'll perform a more detailed analysis to determine the benefits and costs. The key takeaway here is that benefits should always outweigh the cost.

Fantastic, let's keep going. Next, we're going to add in the project scope as well as what's considered out of scope for this project. Remember scope is an agreed upon understanding of what is included or excluded from a project. An item that is in scope, includes creating a service to deliver small plants to last year's top clients. An item that is out of scope, and therefore not available to customers, includes plant care after they're delivered. Amazing. Hopefully you can see how stating what's in scope and what's out of scope helps everyone working on the project understand where they should focus their efforts.

Great, now let's add in your project team. Let's see here. The project sponsor is Office Green's director of product. So let's add that in. Who is the project lead? Well, that's you. The project team may include marketing associates, website developers and external plant vendors and more, so we can add in a few important project team members here. Awesome. Let's move on to additional stakeholders. Additional stakeholders may include the vice president of customer success, who is accountable for customer feedback and corresponding product requests. We can also add in the account manager who will leverage their existing relationships with top clients. And let's also add in the fulfillment manager, who will help acquire the plants needed to launch the service.

We're almost done, let's add in how we'll measure success. Here we will type in that we want to see a five percent increase in revenue by the end of the year. Let's also type in that we want to hit a customer satisfaction rate of 95 percent, three months after launch. That's it. The project charter is filled in and now it's ready to be reviewed by your stakeholders. Now you're done. You've seen how documentation helps form the roots of a project and how it contributes to the project's ultimate success. Like nurturing a plant, you're learning to nurture a project to ensure its the best it can be. Up next, we'll talk about the tools that project managers rely on to guide their teams and ensure that they complete their tasks. See you soon.

### Peer-graded Assignment: Activity: Create a project charter

**Activity Overview**

_Earlier in this course, you examined a sample charter for the Plant Pals project as a whole. For this exercise, you will create a new charter for an upcoming stage of the Plant Pals project. Be aware that most projects have a single charter to set expectations and keep stakeholders aligned. However, creating your own charter for the next stage of the project will give you a chance to practice what you’ve learned._

In this activity, you will fill out a partially-completed project charter. Keep in mind that project charters can differ significantly from project to project and company to company. However, most charters include some variation of the components described in this activity. No matter what form they take, charters lay out project goals, highlight benefits, and align stakeholders.

After you submit your work, review and respond to **at least two** of your classmates’ assignments.

**Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

As the Plant Pals project manager, one of your responsibilities is building an Operations and Training plan for the new service. The creation and implementation of this plan marks a new stage of the Plant Pals project with its own set of goals and deliverables. Its main goal is to create sustainable fulfillment and delivery practices for the service’s day-to-day operations. Putting these processes in place is essential to making a launch of this size successful.

To meet this goal, your team will create internal processes and training procedures for support teams, so they can meet the demands of the Plant Pals service. These processes will help mitigate potential revenue losses due to late shipments and cancellations by ensuring an efficient, high-quality customer experience. By ensuring that Plant Pals runs smoothly, the plan also supports the larger project goal of a 5% revenue increase for Office Green.

You estimate that it will take six months to fully implement all protocols, including setting up operational tools, putting delivery processes in place, and training employees. The Operations and Training plan should stay within a budget of $75,000.

Some of the milestones your team must reach to complete this project include:

- Create a plant delivery and logistics plan to make the fulfillment process as efficient as possible. Your target is to deliver 95% of orders on time within one month of launch. Tasks include purchasing delivery trucks, hiring drivers, and calculating delivery fees. 

- Set up order processing and supply chain management software to make revenue streams more efficient. Your team must select, install, and maintain the software to ensure it continues to function properly. If it does, all orders should be packaged and ready for shipment within two business days of being placed. 

- Maintain excellent service standards by developing and launching an employee training program. You want to train 90% of employees before the official service launch. To reach this milestone, your team needs to create a communications plan, prepare training lessons, and schedule and conduct training sessions.

Your first step is to create a charter to align your stakeholders and map out what your team needs to know to create and implement the plan.

**Step-By-Step Assignment Instructions**

**Step 1: Access the template**

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Link to template: [Project charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtFRAk4GAIEUdBZvct_Jr9RuWyGS8IlmqNiR0kA19y0/template/preview)

Link to Completed Charter: [Project charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17iYDLcaH2EykT3JMc3x_zt_R7dn-PJ9yzdA7q7yBNQE/edit?resourcekey=0-T_ramyjjyBUXBKFPZbbJAw)

**Step 2: Write an executive summary**

Under **Executive Summary**, write 1-3 sentences outlining the project’s purpose and desired outcomes.

For example, if you were writing an executive summary for the Plant Pals project as a whole, it might say:

_“Our plan is to create a service that offers high-volume customers small, low-maintenance plants that can thrive in an office environment.”_

Your summary for the Operations and Training plan charter should follow a similar format.

**Step 3: Fill in the project goal**

In the **Project Goal** section of the charter, record the main project goal of the Operations and Training plan. This goal should be more detailed and specific than your executive summary. Use the information from the scenario to make the goal SMART (**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ttainable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-bound).

For example, one of the SMART goals for the overall Plant Pals project is:

_“Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to top clients.”_

_**Note:** Most projects have multiple goals, but you only need one for this activity._

**Step 4: Identify the project deliverables**

In the **Deliverables** box, record three expected outcomes of the project. Remember, these deliverables can be tangible or intangible project results. 

For instance, one tangible deliverable of the overall Plant Pals project is, _“send 1,000 plants to 100 customers.” An intangible deliverable could be, “increased brand awareness.”_

**Step 5: Determine the business case for the project**

In the **Business Case/ Background** section, explain the reason for the project and how it supports the company’s overall success. Making a business case also gives your team the necessary context for project tasks, so be sure to include any useful background information as well. 

For example, the business case for the overall Plant Pals project might be, _“This is a top requested service from our customers, and it will also improve customer satisfaction and retention.”_

**Step 6: Fill in the benefits and cost areas (optional)**

The **Benefits, Costs, and Budget** section already includes three benefits of the project, three cost areas, and the budget amount. If you would like, you can fill in any additional benefits or cost areas from the scenario. This section of the charter is optional and will not be graded.

For **benefits,** describe what Office Green hopes to get out of the project. This can include direct financial benefits (e.g., sales revenue), as well as indirect benefits (e.g., increased customer trust). Remember that the benefits should support your business case. 

For **costs,** think about how the completing project could impact the company. Consider time and resources in addition to any financial impact.

_**Note:** You don’t need to assign monetary values to these cost areas in this exercise. You will break down the costs of the Plant Pals Operations and Training Plan project in detail in the next course, Project Planning: Putting It All Together.)_

**Step 7: Define the project scope (optional)**

The **Scope and Exclusion** section already contains three areas that are in-scope and two that are out-of-scope for the project. If you want to further define the scope, you can fill in additional in-scope and out-of-scope items. This section of the charter is optional and will not be graded.

_**Note:** The charter should also list the members of your project team. This section has been filled out for you._

**Step 8: Determine how to measure success**

In the **Measuring Success** section, list two examples of success criteria that can help you determine when the project has reached its goal. You can use criteria from the scenario or determine other ways to measure project success. Remember that success criteria should be specific and measurable. 

For instance, success criteria for Plant Pals as a whole could include _“a 5% increase in revenue by the end of the year” or “a 5% increase in customer satisfaction (from 90% to 95%) three months after launch.”_ Both of these criteria include metrics that make it easy to tell when the project has reached its goals.

Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the project charter template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

## Evaluating tools to meet project needs

### Utilizing tools for effective project management

As a project manager, tools are some of the most helpful resources you have at your disposal. They're essential for tracking progress, so it's important to keep them top of mind throughout the entire project. Let's talk more about why tools are so useful and why it's important to choose the right ones for your needs. There are lots of different tools out there, and you'll learn more about them later. As a reminder, tools are aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to manage resources and organize work. They're useful because they can help you track detailed information about all kinds of tasks, and they make it easy to communicate with lots of different people. And remember, effective communication and tracking are huge parts of a project manager's day-to-day responsibilities.

Just think about how much tougher your job would be without help from collaboration tools like e-mail or digital documents created in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. Let's imagine this in the context of our project at Office Green. As lead project manager, you have tons of information about the company's plan to provide office-friendly plants to top clients. But what would happen if you wrote every project detail on a whiteboard instead of a shared online document? Well, every member of your team would have to stop by your desk to get the latest information, and that's definitely not the most efficient use of anyone's time. But if you store this information in easily-accessible online documents, you save everyone on the team time, energy, and a major headache.

Today's tools have made it so much easier to share information with teammates. Even better with project management tools, information sharing goes both ways. That means team members can also easily update you on their progress without the need for extra meetings or phone calls. How great is that? When you choose the right tool for a project, you make it easy for teammates to let you know if a task is on schedule or if it's delayed, which lets you quickly see how any changes might affect the rest of the project. Project management tools increase visibility and transparency for everyone, including stakeholders. You can use a variety of tools to accomplish many different things, like tracking progress on tasks, deliverables, and milestones.

Tools can also help you manage a budget, build helpful charts and diagrams, manage contracts and licenses, and keep stakeholders informed. Tools can be straightforward, like digital spreadsheets or documents, or they can be more sophisticated, like scheduling and work management software. It's important to think about the needs of the project when choosing which to use. One thing to keep in mind is that if you choose a more sophisticated tool, your teammates and stakeholders will need some time to get familiar with it. For small projects, that might be more trouble than it's worth. So for small projects, a straightforward tool might be more effective.

But if a project has a big scope, then it might be worth the team's time to learn and ultimately work with a more sophisticated project management tool. You should also keep in mind that sometimes you won't have a choice about the types of tools you use. If an organization has already decided to use a specific tool, then you will need to work with what they give you. It's all about remaining flexible. Are you starting to see how you can use tools to keep projects on track? Whether they're straightforward or sophisticated, tools have the power to help you communicate and manage more effectively. Next up, we'll cover some of the most common types of tools for effective project management. See you there!

### Introducing new tools to a team

Project management tools and processes are always evolving. In this reading, we will discuss the importance of choosing the right tools for a project and the implications of introducing new tools to your team. 

As a project manager, it is important to be open to implementing new tools that may be beneficial to a project's outcome. You will experience change in lots of forms throughout your project’s life cycle, and navigating change is essential. But if you choose to implement a tool that your team is unfamiliar with—especially if you decide to roll it out midway through a project—your team may be hesitant. People embrace change differently, particularly if the change will directly impact their routine and the way they work. Simply put: Change can be met with resistance.

Before you introduce a new tool to your team, you should be sure that this change is actually going to benefit the project, and ensure that those involved in your project understand the benefits of this change. Demonstrating to your teammates and stakeholders that you understand the tool and have evaluated its competency will help build trust, especially if this new tool is replacing an existing tool. Taking the time to introduce the new tool to your team members will also demonstrate that you have the best interest of the team in mind—not just the success of the project.

Here are some important considerations and keys to successfully introducing new tools:

- **Discuss the tool early and often, if possible.** The team should not feel blindsided by a new change. Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible. This will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool.

- **Ask for feedback from key stakeholders.** You could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority. The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps.

- **Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool.** You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.

- **Ensure the tool is fully functional before the team is introduced to it.** Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn’t live up to how it is supposed to function. This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!

- **Set up training for the tool as needed before you ask the team to actually use it.** Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members’ needs are addressed. Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.

Remember, some pushback is normal, but successful project managers should take the steps to prepare and mitigate any friction for their team when possible.

**Pro tip:** If time allows, plan for a period of transition if you are replacing an existing tool. It is common to allow both tools to operate during this period. You will need to “sunset,” or retire, the existing tool eventually, but allowing for a period of transition between using the old tool and the new tool can help stakeholders and team members feel more at ease and give them time to gain familiarity with the new tool. Be prepared for productivity to be impacted as the team transitions from one tool to another.

### Exploring types of project management tools

So, you've learned about how tools can make you more effective. Now let's learn more about the different types of tools used in project management. These include scheduling and work management software and tools for productivity and collaboration. Let's get started. One common tool type is scheduling and work management software. There are lots of different types of work management software on the market, including popular tools like these. Certain tools may work better for your project depending on a bunch of things; for example, the project methodology you're running or the number of tasks and people involved.

So, why would you choose to use scheduling and work management software? Well, it can be really useful for assigning tasks to multiple teammates and for tracking progress on that work. It can also help you visualize your team's progress. For example, if you're using work management software to assign and track tasks, you're more likely to notice if your team completes 50 tasks one week and just three tasks the following week. That's a clear sign that you need to check in to see if there's a problem that's blocking progress.

If you hadn't been tracking their tasks, you might not have noticed the issue. That's part of the reason why work management software is so useful. It provides an overview of how the project is going so you know when you need to check in with your teams to get tasks back on track. Another type of project management tool we'll discuss is tools for productivity. Productivity tools can be very helpful for you and your team. This includes word processing tools, like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. You can use these to create shared documents with the team, like the project charter we taught you how to fill out earlier.

You can also use these tools to build documents like meeting agendas and status updates, and we'll talk more about these in a later course. Spreadsheets are another useful productivity tool. They're versatile, and you can use them to make documents, like RACI charts and project plans, as well as other helpful charts you'll learn more about in a later course. And presentations created in tools, like Microsoft PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides can be a great way to package your project in a visual, easily-digestible way.

Now, let's discuss collaboration tools, which you'll probably rely on to work closely with your teammates. These include tools you're probably familiar with, like email and chat. Tools like this can help you quickly and efficiently check in with each other on questions, comments, and other topics related to the project. Productivity tools like documents and spreadsheets, and collaboration tools like email and chat, are all pretty simple, which means they're great for smaller projects with fewer tasks and teammates to keep track of. Scheduling and work management software is better for bigger projects with a larger number of tasks and a bigger team of people to manage. Cool. You've learned more about the types of tools available to you, including scheduling and work management software, productivity tools, and collaboration tools. We'll spend the next video diving a bit deeper on some of the most popular project management tools out there.

### Common project management tools

Earlier, you learned about different types of project management tools, from scheduling and work management software, to tools for productivity and collaboration. Now let's discuss a few popular tools you might be expected to use, or at least be familiar with. There are many different types of work management software that automatically make project planning and tracking a lot easier and that are much more efficient than manual project tracking. One tool that we'll focus on in this program is Asana. Asana is a work management platform that helps teams plan and coordinate their work from daily tasks to strategic initiatives. Asana provides a living system and a source of truth where everyone's work lives.

With Asana, everyone can see, discuss, and manage team priorities, giving teams clarity on who is doing what by when. It's great for building project plans, assigning tasks, automating workflows, tracking progress, and communicating with stakeholders. As a project manager, you can use Asana to create a log of tasks, like gathering cost estimates from external vendors, and assign a task to people on the team. All tasks are visible and organized in the format of the project manager's choice—like in a list or on a calendar—and designed to drive transparency and connection with all the tasks related to the overall goal. 

It's easy to use with external stakeholders as well, because within Asana, you can share status updates and other communications with people outside your company. Another great tool we'll focus on throughout this program is the spreadsheet. Spreadsheets are extremely versatile, and you can use them for a wide range of tasks, from creating timelines and billing charts to managing budgets and tracking tasks. You can add and view project information in a variety of formats, depending on what you need in the moment. For example, let's say you enter a list of tasks, due dates, completion statuses, and task owners into a spreadsheet. From there, it's very simple to sort the list by due date to see what's due next.

You can then filter the list of tasks by task owner, so that you only see the things you're responsible for. You can also highlight the rows of the sheet in different colors to visually illustrate the tasks with the least progress. With spreadsheets, you can easily transform, visualize, and manipulate information. Spreadsheets and more comprehensive tools like Asana are just two options for effective project management, and it's a good idea to get a basic understanding of the variety of software options out there. Then, if your company doesn't have a standard software tool, you can choose the right one for the project needs. Being able to recommend the right tool for the job can be a great way to add value to your team at the beginning of a project.

Keep in mind, however, that software options are constantly changing. From the addition of new features to the launch of new tools, there's no way for you to know every software available, and no company would expect that of you. Many of these tools have similar functionality, like task tracking and task assignment, so if you understand one tool deeply, you should be able to easily adapt to a new tool on the job. Now that you've learned a bit more about Asana and the power of spreadsheets, take some time to explore these tools, since we'll be working with them later in the program. Coming up, you'll hear from a project manager who will tell you all about their experience using tools during their day-to-day role at Google.

### Using Google Sheets for project management

#### Essential Sheets features for project management

**Collaborate with your team**

Google Sheets makes it easy to collaborate and share information. This is useful for remote workgroups or working with teams that have different schedules. 

When you share your Sheet, you can select from the following permissions:

- **editing,** which allows others to make direct edits and changes to the file;

- **commenting,** which allows others to add comments and make suggestions; or 

- **view only,** which allows others to view the file but not edit, comment, or suggest. This is a good choice if you don’t want any changes to be made to the file.

Once you’ve shared your Sheet with your team and given them either editing or commenting permissions, you can all collaborate directly in the Sheet by leaving comments. You can also assign a task or action item through comments.

**Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:** [Share and collaborate on files](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9305987?hl=en)

**Format your spreadsheet**

**Create lists**

To create any list in Sheets, simply label each list—for example, Name, Date, Notes, or other criteria—in the **header row.** (The header row is the top row in the spreadsheet.) Then, add a different list item in each cell underneath the list title. Most lists are arranged vertically, but you might prefer a horizontal list depending on the types of items. _Note: You’ll learn how to build out a full project plan and prioritize tasks later in this course._

**Display and hide content**

**Freeze rows or columns**

Freezing the header row (or column for horizontal lists) and formatting headers is a great way to make the list titles stand out. Freezing a header row keeps the row in place when you scroll down the list, so you can always see what the list titles are. Format the headers just like you would text in a document by changing the font, style, size, or color.

**Group and hide related content**

Grouping rows and columns allows you to expand and collapse larger categories of data or information with a single click. This makes your spreadsheet easier to read and manage by hiding the grouped data when it’s not needed, or quickly ungroup and show when it is needed.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_**

- [Google Sheets cheat sheet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300022?hl=en)

**Add checkboxes**

Checkboxes provide a quick and highly-visual way to track progress on a task or indicate whether certain criteria have been met.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Add checkboxes to spreadsheets](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308622?hl=en&ref_topic=9326428)

**Organize data**

**Create dropdown lists**

If you’re working with others on a shared Sheet, you might end up with inconsistent responses or descriptions of data. For example, one teammate may list their task as “done” while another notes it as “complete.” Adding a dropdown list (also referred to as **data validation**) ensures the data entered into your spreadsheet is exactly what you specify. It also makes it much faster for others to add data since they’re selecting from a predetermined list of options.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Restrict data entry with lists](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9604139?hl=en#zippy=%2Clearn-how)

**Add color coding**

Sometimes it’s helpful to change the color of cells and text so you can quickly see how your project is progressing. You can add color coding to your spreadsheet by applying conditional formatting. **Conditional formatting** formats cells in a certain way if they contain specific information. For example, track progress status as “Not started” in red, “In progress” in orange, and “Complete” in green.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [See data changes with conditional formatting](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308962?hl=en&ref_topic=9327402)

**Sort and filter data**

Large sets of data can be difficult to manage. Sheets helps you sort and filter data to limit what is visible and find specific types of data within your spreadsheet.

**Sorting** data allows you to arrange data in exactly the order you want it to appear in, like alphabetical, by date, or progress level. **Filtering** limits what data gets displayed and shows you only the data you are interested in, such as tasks that have not yet been started, or budget items within a certain value range.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Filter data in a spreadsheet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308952?hl=en)

**Add links**

It can be helpful to link to other project documentation or even external websites in your spreadsheet. This provides your team easy, centralized access to all relevant data they might need. For example, you could add a link to your project charter document from your project plan spreadsheet.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_**

- [Use links](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/45893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en#zippy=%2Ccreate-a-link)

- [Link to data in a spreadsheet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308662?hl=en)

**Visualize data**

**Create a pivot table**

A **pivot table** is a basic data analysis tool. Pivot tables summarize your data and can help show the relationships between data points, making it easier to understand all the information contained in your spreadsheet. You’ll learn more about how to create and use a pivot table later in this course. Or, check out the Help Center article below.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Create and edit pivot tables](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308944?hl=en)

**Make a chart or graph**

Presenting data in charts and graphs is a great way to quickly and effectively summarize important information about your project to stakeholders and make reports and presentations more engaging. Sheets enables you to automatically create different kinds of charts and graphs using the data in your spreadsheet.

**_Check out these resources from the Google Help Center to learn more:_** [Insert and edit charts](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308981?hl=en)

**Perform calculations**

**Use functions**

**Functions** can be used to manipulate data and perform calculations. Google Sheets has a wide array of functions that are already built in, which means they will automatically perform the calculations you specify. Use functions to quickly calculate sums or averages, automatically determine start or end dates, generate financial reports, and much more.

- [Google Sheets cheat sheet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300022?hl=en)

#### Useful spreadsheet templates

**Using spreadsheet templates for project management**

Creating the same types of spreadsheets over and over can be time-consuming. You can save time by using templates such as those available from the [Google Sheets template gallery](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/?ftv=1&folder=0AKrj08N1UHZqUk9PVA&tgif=c). Choose from a variety of pre-made spreadsheets for budgets, schedules, and trackers, or create your own!

Some of the more common templates are described and linked below. To use the templates for these course items, click the links below and select “Use Template”:

- **[Project Timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Us-j-BAG3kiIJENBt3SqRXkJQL_TZh-yejJyZzq9L60/template/preview#gid=1709744959):** A project timeline template is useful if you want to track an entire project from conception to close. This example includes a visual timeline that lays out the life cycle of a project and the major activities that need to happen during each phase. You’ll learn more about creating and tracking a project timeline later in the course and get to experience working with your own project timeline templates.

### Demonstrating your knowledge of project management tools

![mY1BrNHgRoWNQazR4DaFHg_b74d8b74ec1641609d0a1d3a4d1c8ff1_Tools](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mY1BrNHgRoWNQazR4DaFHg_b74d8b74ec1641609d0a1d3a4d1c8ff1_Tools.png?expiry=1667260800000&hmac=R0vHI4ZpO6znNGzLS4iOYgkVDQQhBmBv6Z6JWQBVvlQ)

During an interview for a project manager position, the interviewer may ask you to discuss the project management tools you are familiar with or have used in the past. There are many types of project management tools that you will come across during your career. These tools will continue to grow and change as technology improves. Being able to talk about these tools, and how you use them, will be crucial to landing the role.

In addition to the interviewer asking general questions about tools, they may ask more specific questions, like “How do you know if a project is off track?” It’s important to tie this answer back to the types of scheduling tools you have learned about in this course. If you haven’t had experience working with certain scheduling tools, like Smartsheet or digital spreadsheets—try to leverage real-life experience. 

For example, have you ever planned for a move? If so, you can discuss how you planned your timeline and scheduled vendors so that you could meet your move date. Did you use a spreadsheet to keep track of your budget, schedule, and belongings? This experience demonstrates you understand how to use tools. It also demonstrates that you know the importance of creating, monitoring, and managing the project schedule to deliver results at project completion. 

Another related question the interviewer may ask could be, “How do you execute tasks within your timeline?” This is a great opportunity to demonstrate your ability to be productive by sharing your experience with tools, such as digital documents or spreadsheets. These tools help you create project artifacts, track tasks, and store project details in one place! You can also use them as a collaboration tool because they are easily shareable with teammates and stakeholders and allow for real-time updates. 

Finally, there are special project management tools, also called work management tools, that put all the benefits discussed above into one place. Project management tools such as Asana, Monday.com, Basecamp, and Trello are among some of the top ranked tools for managing projects.  These tools help you plan, track, and complete work across many project phases. They often have visually appealing layouts and automated features that save time and create efficiency in a project manager’s day-to-day tasks.  Explaining your knowledge of these tools—and how they benefit the project manager, team, and company—in an interview is a great way to demonstrate that you are qualified for the role.

**Pro tip:** Learn more by trying free tutorials or trial versions of popular project management tools. By navigating project management software, you will be able to explain the uses and functionality of these types of tools firsthand. Here are some examples to get started:

### Build a project management tool tracker

As you progress through this course, you will learn about different types of tools used by project managers and the organizations that hire them. Tools can include software applications like Adobe, Google, and Microsoft and specific work management tools like Jira and Asana. They can also include methodologies, techniques, formulas and concepts, and technologies related to project management. 

This reading provides step-by-step instructions for creating a tracker for all of these types of tools. You can use your tracker to list the different tools you learn about, their descriptions and links, their features and benefits, and your level of experience with each. This way, you can easily identify the tools required for different roles and can determine where you might want to focus your professional development efforts.

**Developing your tool tracker spreadsheet**

Follow these steps to begin creating your project management tool tracker:

**Step 1: Create a new spreadsheet**

Start by opening a new spreadsheet using your preferred method. If you have a Google account, click the link to open a [Project Management Tool Tracker Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HyBhk8e1w7N_MIlLBvFtPTOy4-I_6Ig_MA1nd5LqYQE/template/preview?resourcekey=0-_cR_r4OEpzHxfJzpCEUNrQ#gid=0).

Some of the information has already been filled in for you as an example. Feel free to modify your Tracker in the way that works best for you.

**Step 2: Add column headers**

Consider the different types of information you’d like to track about each tool, and add these as column headers in your tracker. (The header is the top cell or cells in a column in the spreadsheet.)

Here are some example column headers:

- Tool Name

- Description/Benefits

- Link to product website

- Link to course content in Coursera

- Cost to use

- Requirements (training/equipment)

- Your current experience with the tool 

- Notes

![K1VZr4zDTImVWa-MwyyJ9A_df63e80421664d69aafc419889e70bf1_tooltracker1](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/K1VZr4zDTImVWa-MwyyJ9A_df63e80421664d69aafc419889e70bf1_tooltracker1.png?expiry=1667260800000&hmac=wq264MjM8Faxm-RTWBllaH1e_PU_v0UOI74xV0jxvis)

**Step 3: Add tools and relevant information**

Review some of the course videos, readings, and activities so far that discuss project management tools. Select three or four tools and add the names to the tracker. Add any information you have about each tool to the different columns. To help you get started, the template has several tools listed that have already been mentioned in this course. Feel free to edit the list to include the tools that are most relevant to your progress.

You might not be able to fill in all the columns with information just from this course, so do your own research if necessary.

For example, we discuss the work management tool Asana in the video [Common project management tools](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/lecture/T12Jz/common-project-management-tools), but we only cover some of the features and benefits. You can look up the Asana website online and add more information about what features are offered, along with pricing and system requirements.

**Step 4: Format your sheet**

After you’ve added a few tools and some initial information, format your sheet by bolding column headers and adding drop-down lists, conditional formatting, or web links. Try out other formatting options like bolding, highlighting, or colors to make important text stand out. [Google Sheets training and help](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282959#zippy=) contains articles with step-by-step directions for how to use all of these features and more.

**Step 5: Continue adding tools**

Continue to add more tools and information that’s relevant to your career goals. Search job listings and add tools, software, or specific knowledge needed for jobs you’re interested in.

![rUo_46UUQPCKP-OlFPDwXA_f0fbcf80dfb74901bd67ead0f1a3e7f1_joblistings.png](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/rUo_46UUQPCKP-OlFPDwXA_f0fbcf80dfb74901bd67ead0f1a3e7f1_joblistings.png?expiry=1667260800000&hmac=tT5qbms9t7J9TQzHQVEAuJm_GzQ84E07P-47zvC_b-k)

**Key takeaway**

If you’ve followed the steps laid out in this reading, you'll be able to develop a tracker that is useful to you as you continue on your project manager journey. Knowing what tools are available, what their benefits are, which ones are used for certain types of projects, and which ones you're skilled at will build your confidence. You'll be able to demonstrate to employers that you have an understanding of the industry, even if you're applying for your first project management role.

### Amar: Tools are our best friends

Hi, I'm Amar. I'm a Senior Engineering Program Manager at Google Shopping, and on a day-to-day basis, I drive programs which span across multiple products at Google. As a Project Manager, tools are our best friends. Tools and the tools which will help us drive the execution—those should be near and dear to us, and those are near and dear to me. What I look at is what tools will help me create the body of work. There are a lot of open source tools as free tools, like Google Spreadsheets are there, Google Docs is there.

Many of these tools are out there, and there are some other supporting tools also, like JIRA and ALM. These will help you create the body of work. This will help you define that what needs to be delivered and when. This will help you create the timeline. There are timeline tools, like Gantt Chart, Gantt tools, that you will find out. Then there are tools which will help you drive the visibility across the board and that drive the dependent ecosystem. We want to make sure when we are starting the project, we look at the available toolset so that we are not defragging the system that much, we are not really kind of adding too many complexities on new tools in the ecosystems.

We want make sure that, ok, what are the current tools which are out there? Have a look at this toolset. Find out, are those supported? Find out what's the current adoption rate, and look at what are the gaps. If there are gaps, go for new tools. Propose new tools to improve productivity. But if there's an existing toolset which our team is following, which your team is following, try to learn those tools because those are the tools which will get quick adoption, and those will be an amazing toolset to have with you.

### Course wrap-up

Nice work! Getting through all this material is a huge accomplishment. Take a moment to consider how much you've learned so far about the ins and outs of successfully kicking off a project. You dug deeper on initiation, the first phase of the project life cycle, and how important it is to determine your project scope, including what's in-scope and what's not. You also learned about project goals and deliverables, and you learned how to measure project success by creating success criteria early on.

Then you learned to define project roles and responsibilities. Choosing the right people for a project team is a big decision and one you'll always want to consider carefully. You now know how to create a stakeholder analysis that tells you how and when to communicate with different stakeholders, and you learned how to create and track team accountability using a RACI chart.

You also studied the final steps of the initiation phase: identifying resources, creating documentation, and selecting tools. You learned about the resources that project managers rely on to achieve the goals of a project, from budgets to people to the materials needed to complete a deliverable. You also learned the value of documenting your work using a project charter, which is a key step to getting approval to start your project.

Lastly, you learned about the many types of tools that can help you be a more efficient project manager—from straightforward tools like email, to sophisticated tools like Asana. Completing this course is no small feat, and you've put in hours of work. Give yourself a pat on the back! You've earned it. In the next course, you'll jump right into the next phase of the project life cycle, and my colleague, Rowena, will be your guide. Get ready to have some fun as Rowena shows you the ropes of serious project planning!

## Getting started with the course

### Introduction to Course 3

Hello! Welcome to this course called "Planning: Putting It All Together." If you've already completed our previous courses, then you have a great foundation for what it takes to initiate a project and kick off the planning phase. Before we get started, let me introduce myself. My name is Rowena, and I'll be your instructor for this course. I work as a senior program manager in Google Cloud on a variety of projects. I mostly focus on systems and productivity enhancements for my team, which consists of around 100 full time employees and more than 300 contractors around the world. Some of the largest-scale projects that I work on impact Google Cloud sales and global sales support teams, which are made up of a thousands of people.

But I didn't start out building solutions for thousands of people at a global company. I left school at the age of 17 with no college degree and no real plan. Before Google, I worked in retail, hospitality, and even in the airline industry as a crew member. When I joined the corporate world, I noticed something. The processes were just as messy as the stock rooms of the retail stores where I'd worked. There was so much room to improve. I came to realize that every business is complicated and that there's always room to create order. So I started thinking about ways to automate my day-to-day tasks.

I was emailing ideas to my manager and colleagues, working with teams across the company, brainstorming solutions to problems, coordinating training for my coworkers, and so much more. That's when it became clear— I was project managing. I transferred into a role focused entirely on program management at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. In my job interview, I focused on examples of how I applied these transferable skills from my previous roles, and how I could leverage the knowledge I gained from my experience. Four years later, I'm here and I'm so excited to be partnering with you on this learning journey.

From the outside, big, global companies can seem as though they have it all figured out. But there's always room for new processes, and you likely have the skills and insights from your previous experiences that can be useful. So keep going— you're heading in the right direction. This course is focused on the planning phase. I'll share the tools and techniques to complete this phase. First up, I'll demonstrate how to kick off the planning phase. Then we'll explore the importance of setting and reaching milestones.

For every milestone, there'll be a set of tasks to complete, so I'll teach you some tips for breaking down and distributing the workload. Later, we'll discuss the budget and how the overall budgeting process works. We'll learn about people or companies outside of your organization that may play a role in determining the budget, and we'll discuss the importance of sufficiently documenting your budget. Then we'll discuss the various risks and the possible impact those risks can have on the project. Nothing ever goes quite as planned, but risk management is a great way to make sure you know what could go wrong and how you'll address it.

This includes communicating possible risks to your stakeholders, creating a mitigation plan, and then keeping an eye on those risks to make sure they don't stall your projects. Last but not least, documentation ties it all together. Keeping all your project plans documented and organized not only helps you, but it also helps those involved knowing their responsibilities. Documentation also provides stakeholders with a window into the development of the project. It has always been important to the success of my own projects at Google, and I'm excited to explore this topic with you.

### Course 3 overview

Hello! Welcome to the third of the six courses in the Google Project Management Certificate program. This course will explore how to map out a project in the second phase of the project life cycle: the project planning phase.

## Understanding the planning phase components

### The benefits of project planning

In the previous course, you learned about the initiation phase. During the initiation phase, the project manager is gathering all of the necessary preliminary information needed to get stakeholder approval and plan the project. A few key things need to happen during this time. First, the project manager gets assigned—that's you! Then, the goals of the project have to be approved, as well as the scope of the project and its deliverables. A number of people will need to be assigned to the project, and you'll have a good sense of their individual roles and responsibilities. You'll also need stakeholder sign off on your project charter.

If all of these criteria have been met, then you're set to begin planning. Planning is a significant part of ensuring a project's success, so let's take some time to discuss why it's so important. Planning is important for any project, large or small. While planning your project, you and other members of the team will determine the processes and workflows needed to meet your goals and put together ideas about how to make the project a success. While planning, you might draw from previous project experience, but don't be afraid to think of new ways to get results. Every project is different, so new and different approaches may be just the thing you need.

Planning has many benefits. As we've discussed, planning helps you map out the full project. It helps you understand the work needed to achieve your goals. Planning also helps coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors, and vendors. Another huge benefit of planning is that it gives you time to identify and prepare for risks that could impact your project. Those might include things like a delay in the timeline, the departure of a critical team member, or a change in project direction from a primary stakeholder. Planning also gives you the chance to brainstorm ways to mitigate or address those risks. There are less obvious benefits too. For example, the planning phase can help you get "buy-in" from key members of the project team.

Getting buy-in means that you've gained their support for your plans. Planning also demonstrates to stakeholders that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan. But one of the most significant benefits of planning is teamwork, which will help you push your project across the finish line. By working together in the planning phase, individuals assigned to the project can become a strong team by the time the planning is done and the work is about to start. Planning together creates a shared understanding among all parties involved in the project. So to recap, planning has many benefits from helping the team to understand the work needed to achieve their goals, to providing project plans to the stakeholders. Now that you know a bit more about planning, we'll learn how to launch the planning phase.

### Launching the planning phase

In the last video, we discussed the importance of planning. Now let's get into the details of how to launch the planning phase. As you learned earlier, the planning phase is the second phase of a project's life cycle. This can be a challenging time for a project manager because there's so much to consider. But it's important to know that project plans don't have to be perfect the very first time. And, even if you do a great job with your plans the first time around, it's likely that the plan will change as the project evolves. The planning phase may differ from project to project, but generally three big things are worked out during this stage: the schedule, the budget, and the risk management plan. We'll discuss each of these in greater detail later on in the course.

But for now, here's some general information so you can understand why these three elements are so crucial to planning. Let's start with the schedule. The schedule is basically a timeline of the project. It includes the start date, the end date, and the dates for things that will happen in between. You will use time estimation techniques to determine these dates. Let's imagine scheduling in our example project at Office Green. As a reminder, you are the lead project manager for project Plant Pals, a new service that will provide top clients with desk-friendly plants. You want to launch the service by the end of the year, so the planning phase for this effort should include a number of key dates. Those dates might include when you'll request proposals from plant vendors.

They might also include the date you'll kick off with the web designers and developers who are creating a new website for the service. It should also include important dates during the project execution phase, like when the plants need to be ready for delivery or when the new webpage design needs to be approved, and you'll need to include the target date for the launch of the service. Another part of the planning phase is setting the budget. The budget will account for the total cost to complete the project. The total cost needs to be broken down to determine how much has to be spent on different elements of the project.

For project Plant Pals, the budget will need to include items like the cost of designing and launching a webpage, the cost of hiring your plant vendor, and much more. The third component of the planning phase is risk management, which means searching for possible problems and planning ahead to mitigate these risks. Let's face it, risk is inevitable in every project. What's not inevitable is how the risk impacts your project. Good project planning means searching for places where trouble might occur. Where might the schedule get off track? Where might the budget exceed your estimates? You'll work with your team to consider answers to these questions and prepare a risk management plan based on whatever you discover.

Let's go back to the Office Green example. While putting together the initial schedule, you may realize that your estimates from your developers put you way beyond your launch date. To manage that risk, you might try to reduce or adjust the project's scope to still meet your deadline or even negotiate a new launch date with your stakeholders. These are two simple examples of how you might mitigate a scheduling risk. So to recap, you'll spend the planning phase building your schedule, setting your budget, and preparing your risk management plan, but first you need to get the whole team on board. Next, we'll discuss the project kick-off meeting, which is where the project really gets going.

So to recap, you'll spend the planning phase building your schedule, setting your budget, and preparing your risk management plan, but first you need to get the whole team on board. Next, we'll discuss the project kick-off meeting, which is where the project really gets going.

### Facilitating a project kick-off meeting

In this video, you will learn how to schedule a kickoff meeting, once you're ready to shift into planning mode. It's important to schedule a meeting that will serve as a formal start to project planning. You might be wondering what a kickoff meeting is and how it differs from other types of meetings. That's a great question. A project kickoff meeting is the first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roles within the team. So who's invited to the kickoff meeting? Well, that would be the team members identified in a RACI chart, created during the initiation phase.

As a reminder, a RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure that the work gets done efficiently. During the kickoff meeting, team members will learn more about how they'll contribute to the project and how they'll gain a deeper understanding of how the team will work together to reach the project's goals. You should also invite your stakeholders and your sponsor to the meeting, so that they have a chance to understand the high-level plan for the project, can share their perspective, and you can ensure that everyone is on the same page. Now, you might be wondering, why do I need a kickoff meeting? Can't my team learn everything they need to know from the project charter? We get it.

Meetings can be time-consuming, and there are definitely situations when a quick email or a chat to a teammate will suffice. But when you're kicking off a project, especially larger projects with multiple people involved, it's important to get together to establish a shared vision, align on the scope, and build team rapport. This is also an opportunity for teammates to ask questions and offer insights, and it's a great time for you to set expectations with the team about how each person will individually contribute to the project. Now, let's discuss how to plan and run a kickoff meeting. There are lots of templates for kickoff meeting agendas online, but most follow a similar structure and last about an hour.

Keep in mind that this is just a suggestion, and you should feel free to schedule as much or as little time for each agenda item according to the needs of your project and the team. Most meetings start with brief introductions. You can allocate about 10 minutes for everyone in the group to introduce themselves and their roles, and if time allows, share a fun fact to help build team rapport. Then you'll spend about five minutes giving an overview of the background of the project. This covers details like how the project came to be and why the project matters. You'll also use this time to set a shared vision.

Next, spend about five minutes sharing the goals and the scope, which refers to the boundaries around a project. That includes making it clear what work is considered in-scope, and what work is considered out-of-scope. This is also a good place to share the target launch date and highlight any important milestones the team needs to be aware of. Once you've covered goals and scope, it's time to discuss everyone's roles. It's a good idea to spend about five minutes making sure that everyone is clear on what work they'll be responsible for throughout the duration of the project. Next, it's time to address collaboration, which is how the team will work together on the project.

This is a great time to go over tools that will serve as a communal source of information for the team, like a project plan created in a spreadsheet or work management software tool like Asana. It's also a great time to determine how the team will communicate with one another, like through daily email updates, a team chat room, and weekly team check-in meetings. You should spend about 10 minutes on this topic. When that's all set, it's time to discuss what comes next. Now that you've discussed the details of the project thus far, you should spend about 10 minutes setting expectations with your teammates for what's coming up. You'll also use this time to make clear to each teammate what actions they will need to take next.

Finally, it's really important to set aside about 15 minutes for questions from the group. This is your team's chance to gain clarity on any of the topics you've discussed so far. It's also your chance to hear from the team and ensure that the project is benefiting from diversity of thoughts, experiences, and ideas. For example, in addition to fielding questions out loud in the meeting, I might invite teammates to input their questions or feedback in a shared document. This practice can help create space for collaboration. I also like to poll my teammates for confidence on the topics discussed that day.

I ask what their confidence level is on a scale of one to five: one being "I'm not confident at all," and five being "I'm extremely confident." If they're not confident, I ask them what I can do to help change that. This practice can give the team a stronger sense of support, because they know I'm there to help them through roadblocks. If you try this practice in your meetings, be sure to deliver on any promises you make there. Your reputation as a project manager to get things done and remove roadblocks is critical to building and maintaining relationships.

So to recap, the kickoff meeting will cover introductions, project background, goals and scope, roles, collaboration, and what comes next, and the meeting will leave time for questions from the group at the end. Once you've finalized the meeting agenda, document this information into a meeting agenda template, and send it to attendees a day or two ahead of the meeting. As the project manager, you'll be leading the majority of this meeting, and when you're presenting, it's difficult to take notes and present at the same time. So, at the start of the meeting, ask a teammate to take notes on key points you discussed throughout the session and to record each teammate's action items. In some cases, it may be beneficial to record this meeting so that attendees can revisit it later, especially if you have a large or dispersed team.

Just be sure to get each attendee's permission to record ahead of time. After the meeting, don't forget to send a follow-up email to the group, summarizing key points and outcomes from the meeting, as well as any action items to the attendees. In your follow-up email, be sure to also invite attendees to reach out if they have any additional questions. While there's a lot that goes into the kickoff meeting, remember that this is an exciting moment for the team and especially for you as the project manager. All of the careful thinking and hard work that you've done during the initiation phase comes together to form the foundation of your project. Coming up, we'll learn about milestones, tasks, and how they differ.

### Tips for leading a successful kick-off meeting

In the previous video, you learned what a project **kick-off meeting** is and what it involves. As a reminder, a kick-off meeting is the first meeting among the project team, stakeholders, and the project sponsor at the start of a new project or new project phase. The purpose of a kick-off meeting is to ground everyone in a shared vision, ensure they understand the project’s goals and scope, and make sure that they are all on the same page about their roles and responsibilities on the project. The kick-off meeting is critical to a project’s overall success. It gets the team together to align on goals and visions for the project and sets the project up for success.

This reading will provide you with some tips for running an effective kick-off meeting.

**Kick-off meeting best practices**

- **Set the right time.** Choose a meeting time that works for everyone. Be mindful of time zone differences. 

- **Set the right length.** Choose an appropriate meeting length—no more than one hour. You don’t want to waste people’s time, but you also don’t want to run out of time. Kick-off meetings work best when you first share key information and then spend any additional time on questions and team building.

- **Invite the right people.** Be strategic about including the appropriate people. The goal is to invite attendees who play a role in the development and execution of the project, such as all team members, stakeholders, and the project sponsor. You don’t want to leave anyone out, but you also don’t want to invite people who shouldn’t be there.

- **Designate a notetaker.** The discussion that takes place during the meeting is important. It is critical that you document any feedback, changes, or questions asked by attendees. If you are leading the meeting, designate someone else to take notes before the meeting starts. You can also use tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Google Docs, or Microsoft OneNote.

- **Set the agenda.** To recap what we discussed in the video, a kick-off meeting agenda should generally include: introductions, the project background and purpose, project goals and scope, roles and responsibilities, the collaboration process and project tools, what comes next (expectations and action items), and time for questions and discussion.

- **Share the agenda.** Prior to the meeting, share the agenda with attendees via email and identify speakers for each topic. By sending the agenda in advance, everyone will have an idea of what to expect, time to prepare for anything they may need to present or discuss, and time to generate questions or ideas.

- **Stick to the agenda.** During meetings, discussions can sometimes go off topic or take longer than expected. As a project manager, it is your job to keep the meeting on track by redirecting discussions to the items on the agenda. 

- **Follow up after the meeting.** After the meeting, make sure to send out a meeting summary featuring the meeting notes and any action items.

## Defining tasks and milestones

### Understanding tasks and milestones

As we've discussed throughout this program, the project manager is responsible for assigning work to the team and keeping track of the project's progress. When we discuss assigning work, we'll use a few key terms, project milestones, and project tasks. Let's break these down. A project milestone is an important point within the project schedule that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project.

These are significant checkpoints in your project, and keeping track of them helps ensure that your project is on schedule to meet its goals. For example, a milestone might include completing the first draft of a report, and the goal may be to ultimately publish the report. Another example of a milestone is receiving sign off, or approval from your customer on a major deliverable. Let's discuss how milestones differ from project tasks. A project task is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time.

The work of a project is broken down into many different tasks. In order to reach a milestone, you and your team must complete multiple tasks. For example, if a milestone is completing the first draft of a report, the tasks required to get to that milestone might include hiring a writer, conducting research, and drafting different sections of the report. Let's imagine milestones and tasks in the context of Project Plant Pals at Office Green. One of your project deliverables is to launch a website for your new service, where customers will be able to place orders and get customer support.

Some of the milestones leading up to that launch will include securing approval on the website design and implementing feedback from user testing. To achieve those milestones, your team needs to complete multiple project tasks. For example, in order to reach the design milestone, your website designer will need to create initial mockups of the proposed website design. You'll need to review those mockups, and the designer will need to implement your feedback. Each of these items is a project task, and you won't reach your milestone until they're complete.

To review, milestones are important points within the project schedule, and project tasks are activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time to help reach those milestones. Milestones and project tasks are interconnected. Tasks ladder up to milestones, which are crucial for project tracking. Now that you know more about milestones, project tasks, and how the two differ, we'll learn more about the importance of milestones in the next video. I'll meet you there.

### The importance of setting milestones

So you've learned that a milestone is an important point within the project schedule that highlights progress and usually marks the completion of a deliverable or phase in the project. But now, let's talk about why setting milestones within your project is so important. While it might seem tempting to make a quick to-do list and get on with the project, it's really important that you take the time and effort to break your project down piece by piece. Here's why. First, setting milestones gives you a clear understanding of the amount of work your project will require. The act of setting milestones forces you to break your project down into more manageable chunks. The further you go, the better you'll be able to see how much work will be needed to meet the project goals.

At first glance, it might seem simple to launch a new website, but it might be more work than you think. If you break that deliverable down into milestones and those milestones into tasks, you will have a better sense of the true amount of work that needs to be done. This will help you better manage the project workload. Another reason milestones are so great is that they can help keep your project on track. When you set a milestone, you assign clear deadlines for when certain project deliverables need to be completed. Then, as you work through the execution phase, you can look back at these deadlines to make sure that the project is progressing at the right pace.

A third reason you'll want to set milestones is that they help you uncover areas where you might need to adjust scope, timelines, or resources to meet your goals. For example, if you realize that reaching a milestone will require more tasks than you'd anticipated, you might ask a stakeholder for permission to reduce the scope of the project and cut down on the number of tasks. And finally, there's one more reason milestones are so important. Actually reaching milestones can seriously motivate your team and illustrate real progress to your stakeholders. With big projects that go on for months, you'll want to keep the teams motivation high.

A milestone signifies the completion of an important chunk of work and provides a moment of celebration for the team, even if there's more work ahead. Milestones also serve as a great check-in point to highlight your progress to stakeholders. It gives them the opportunity to see the work that's been completed so far and lets them see everything is on track and up to their standards. It's also important to remember that milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order because, usually, reaching the next milestone is dependent on completing a previous milestone. Think about this in terms of Project Plant Pals at Office Green.

As we discussed earlier, in order to launch a website for a new plant service, there are a few milestones you need to hit, like securing approval of a website design, completing development of the website, and implementing user feedback. These milestones must happen in this order. Here's why. The web developer can't build the website if the design hasn't been approved by stakeholders, and you can't implement feedback from user testing if there's no website to test. So we know it's important to reach milestones in sequential order, but it's just as important that you reach them on time. If the team misses the mark to complete a deliverable tied to a specific milestone, it could set back your project schedule, meaning your team might need to work overtime or add additional resources to catch up.

For example, if you need to secure stakeholder approval on a website design by Friday but the web designer hasn't completed the design yet, you might have to wait until after the weekend to secure stakeholder approval. This will delay the start of the development phase, giving your team less time to build the website. Even worse, this delay could affect the project budget if completing this deliverable directly ties to a payment from the client. If you miss the deadline, you will likely delay receipt of that payment. You might even risk losing the payment altogether. Though deadlines are sometimes flexible, it's important to be extra mindful of milestones where the deadline is non-negotiable. And that's that! Hopefully, you understand why milestones are important to any project. Coming up, we'll discuss how to set milestones for your project.

### How to set milestones

Okay, so you know that milestones are pretty important. They help give you a clear picture of the amount of work required. They help your project stay on track, uncover areas where you might need additional resources, motivate your teammates, and show progress to your stakeholders. So now, let's talk about identifying milestones within your project and how you can set deadlines for each one. The first step to setting a milestone is to evaluate your project as a whole. It helps to refer back to your project charter to remind yourself of the project goal. Then, make a list of what your team needs to do to achieve that goal.

The big items that indicate progress are your milestones. These are the key points within the project schedule that signify the completion of a project deliverable or a phase in the project. Smaller items, like any item that a stakeholder wouldn't need to review, for example, are tasks. You'll plan for these once you've separated them out from the milestones. So let's go back to our Office Green example. One of the project deliverables is a new website. And as we determined earlier, some milestones through our Office Green website scenario include securing approval of website design, completing development of the website, and implementing user feedback.

Mocking up initial designs or building a landing page are smaller items on your list, so those are marked as tasks. Try to keep in mind that some projects might have many milestones, while others might just have two or three. There's no one right number of milestones to set —the number will vary from project to project. Once you've determined your milestones, the next step is to assign each one a deadline. Reaching each of your milestones is dependent on the completion of multiple project tasks. So to make sure you give your team a fair amount of time to complete each of those tasks, you'll need to space your milestones out accordingly. For a larger, months-long project like Project Plant Pals, you shouldn't expect to meet multiple milestones in the span of a week.

Mocking up website designs and collecting insights from user testing are big tasks that take time. You need to space milestones out to give your team room to complete their work. To get a good sense of timing, you can connect with teammates to discuss the tasks required to reach each milestone and get their estimates for how long these tasks will take. With those estimates in mind, you can make an informed decision about reasonable deadlines for each milestone. When you set deadlines for milestones, you will also want to consider the needs of your stakeholders.

Ask yourself when they'll expect to see a certain project deliverable, and consider the answer when choosing a deadline. Your stakeholders will want to see regular indications that the team is making progress, and milestones are a great way to show that progress. So to recap, you set milestones by looking at your project as a whole and pulling out important checkpoints that show progress. Then you assign deadlines to each milestone while keeping the needs of your stakeholders top of mind. Next up, we'll discuss a helpful tool for breaking down the tasks that ladder up to each milestone.

### Setting milestones: Best practices

You have learned what milestones and tasks are and when, where, and how you will use them as a project manager. In this reading, we will explore best practices for setting milestones. But first, let’s revisit the definitions of tasks and milestones.

- A **project task** is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time and is assigned to one or more individuals for completion. The work of a project is broken down into many different project tasks. 

- A **project milestone** is an important point within the project schedule that usually signifies the completion of a major deliverable. Milestones are significant checkpoints in your project, and keeping track of them helps ensure that your project is on schedule to meet its goals.

![d1Qj7ltySpyUI-5bckqcew_963ffd147d6c4d32bf15b0230e9fb4fa_Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-1.58.28-PM](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/d1Qj7ltySpyUI-5bckqcew_963ffd147d6c4d32bf15b0230e9fb4fa_Screen-Shot-2021-02-01-at-1.58.28-PM.png?expiry=1667433600000&hmac=6sGCGx9zrWW5SsoLCjlUuCbz6Ru5It_Y81Ki5HYPOYY)

**Set tasks to identify milestones**

Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Top-down scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.

2. **Bottom-up scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone.

Most projects have many tasks that lead to milestones. For instance, if your milestone is to receive approval on the first draft of an article that you are writing, you might complete tasks such as “develop outline,” “write first draft,” and “send to the editor.” Then, you may have another set of tasks to achieve before reaching the milestone of revising the article. Milestones serve as check-in points along your project to make sure that you are headed in the right direction toward the end goal. Milestones also make projects more manageable.

**Integrate milestones into your project schedule**

There is not a consistent number of milestones in every project. Some projects will have a few milestones, while others may have dozens. Rather than aiming to hit a certain number of milestones, try to set milestones for the most important events in your project. Review your project schedule and identify important moments or checkpoints. In other words, pinpoint where in your project you will achieve major goals and make those points your milestones.

**Milestone-setting pitfalls**

Here are some things to avoid when setting milestones:

- **Don’t set too many milestones.** When there are too many milestones, their importance is downplayed. And, if milestones are too small or too specific, you may end up with too many, making the project look much bigger than it really is to your team and stakeholders.

- **Don’t mistake tasks for milestones.** Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.

- **Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately.** Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones.

**Key takeaways**

Your approach to setting milestones may differ from project to project, but most projects will have at least one milestone and several smaller tasks associated with each milestone. Setting clearly-defined, distinct tasks, and milestones, integrating them into your project schedule, and using a tool that visualizes them together will help organize your project and drive it forward.

### Creating a work breakdown structure

So we've discussed how to set milestones. Now we'll learn how to account for the many tasks that ladder up to each milestone. You can do this by creating a work breakdown structure. Let's start with a definition. A work breakdown structure, often abbreviated to WBS, is a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed. This is a helpful tool because it helps break down the sometimes intimidating challenges of a project into more manageable chunks. Big projects like publishing a report or organizing a conference seem a lot less daunting when the work required to get there is broken down step-by-step with a clear pathway from the beginning of the project to the end.

Let's look at an example of a basic work breakdown structure. There are lots of different ways to design a work breakdown structure, but one common way is to create a tree diagram of project tasks. Let's say that we're creating a work breakdown structure for the Project Plant Pals website launch. At the top of the diagram is the name of the project. The second level of our diagram breaks the project down into three milestones. These include securing design approval, developing the site and implementing user feedback. At the third level of the chart, we can see each of those milestones gets further broken down into a series of project tasks. For example, tasks listed beneath your design approval milestone include mocking up designs and collecting feedback.

This is a very simple example of a work breakdown structure. Here, we've only created a work breakdown structure for a new website, which is just one of the Project Plant Pals deliverables. Keep in mind that in future project management roles, you'll likely create a WBS that outlines the tasks for an entire project. It's also important to know that while creating a work breakdown structure is a helpful exercise for visualizing the tasks of the project, you wouldn't typically include this type of diagram in your official project plan. Instead, you'd input the tasks identified through this exercise into a spreadsheet or your chosen work management software, where you can more easily assign owners to each task. Okay.

So after completing a work breakdown structure and organizing those tasks in a spreadsheet, a few things should be clearer to you. First, you should have a set of discrete project tasks that ladder up to each of your milestones. You and your teammates will know exactly what needs to happen to reach your first milestone and the milestones after that. Second, you're now in a good position to assign those tasks to members of the project team. Each person should have a clear understanding of the tasks they own and the order in which they need to complete them. Let's break down how to assign tasks. Tasks are typically assigned according to a person's role in the project.

For example, in our Office Green scenario, the web designer is assigned to the task of mocking up the initial website design, you are assigned to the task of reviewing that design and providing feedback, and the designer is assigned to the task of implementing your feedback. A web developer will be assigned to the next task of developing the site itself. Sometimes, your team will have multiple teammates working in the same type of role. To assign tasks between two or more team members with the same roles, you might take into consideration each person's familiarity with the tasks at hand. For example, if you have multiple web developers working on the new website, you might task one developer with creating the landing page and task the other developer with creating the "contact us" page.

When assigning tasks, you should also consider each teammate's workload. Think about how much time they're meant to be spending on the project compared to work outside the project that they may also be responsible for. It's important to keep everyone's workloads balanced. You'll want to make sure that a single teammate isn't assigned more work than others. You'll also want to make sure that no one is assigned more work than they can handle. When people feel overloaded, the quality of their work may suffer or they might need more time to complete the number of tasks, putting the timeline and the overall project schedule at risk.

As the project manager, you will ensure that your teammates are clear on their assigned tasks. You can do this by assigning tasks with help from project management tools like Asana, which I use a lot in my day-to-day role at Google. When you manage a project in Asana, you'll add tasks to represent actionable pieces of work needed to complete the project. As a best practice, it's good to start each task with a verb. For example, instead of just typing "website," make clear the task is to "mock up the website" or "add images to the website." Another thing to think about when assigning tasks is timeline. Be sure to add an assignee and a due date to each task so it's clear who's doing what by when.

Finally, be sure to include as much detail surrounding the task as possible to avoid miscommunication. In Asana, you can click into the task details to add helpful information. Here, you can add a description, link to corresponding files or attachments, or even comment on the work related to the task. There's so many benefits to assigning tasks, but the biggest one is that it frees you up to focus on managing a project. This way, you can feel confident in the knowledge that your teammates are responsible for specific work. But there's also some less obvious benefits of assigning tasks. Let's explore these more now. One less obvious benefit of assigning tasks is that it creates a sense of personal responsibility for members of the team. When you assign a teammate to a task, you enter into an agreement with that person that they'll own the task until it's completed.

Creating a sense of ownership for members of the team is important because it makes them feel more invested in the project. It also gives them space for personal growth. Plus, it supports your own skill-building as a manager who's a supportive delegator. And on top of that, it keeps your team motivated and invested in completing their work on time. While each team member should have a sense of responsibility for their assigned task, a complete sense of ownership might feel overwhelming for some teammates. If that's the case, it's a good idea for a project manager to encourage teammates to support one another on their tasks. This is also great for building overall team rapport. Got all that? Great. So to recap, you've learned about work breakdown structures and how to assign tasks to people on your team. Meet us in the next video for a recap on what we've covered over the past few videos.

### Breaking down the work breakdown structure

In the previous video, you were introduced to a major component of the planning phase: the creation of a **work breakdown structure** (WBS). A WBS is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. It’s a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project into a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed.

A thorough WBS gives you a visual representation of a project and the tasks required to deliver each milestone. It makes it easier to understand all of the essential project tasks, such as estimating costs, developing a schedule, assigning roles and responsibilities, and tracking progress. Think of each piece of information as part of the overall project puzzle—you can’t successfully navigate through the tasks without understanding how they all fit together. For instance, many smaller tasks may ladder up to a larger task or milestone.

![Scu_G9LBQnaLvxvSwQJ2tg_16120ff266654e17b1a393b519ff82f1_WBS](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Scu_G9LBQnaLvxvSwQJ2tg_16120ff266654e17b1a393b519ff82f1_WBS.jpg?expiry=1667520000000&hmac=xPzIsGimMuABEGjH6688LLE-DqrtFFYNc7QN8rZGdvI)

**Steps to build a WBS**

As a reminder, here are three main steps to follow when creating a WBS:

- **Start with the high-level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones.** Example: Imagine you are planning a company event. Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,”  “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”

- **Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.** Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on.

- **Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.** Example: You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on.
